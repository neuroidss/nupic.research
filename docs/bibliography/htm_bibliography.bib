In order to generate accurate internal representations of the external world, the brain must decode both types of encoded information, even when processing stationary stimuli. We review here evidence in support of a parallel processing scheme for spatially and temporally encoded information in the tactile system and discuss the advantages and limitations of sensory-derived temporal coding in both the tactile and visual systems.

abstract = {We propose a formal mathematical model for sparse representations in neocortex based on a neuron model and associated operations. The design of our model neuron is inspired by recent experimental findings on active dendritic processing and NMDA spikes in pyramidal neurons. We derive a number of scaling laws that characterize the accuracy of such neurons in detecting activation patterns in a neuronal population under adverse conditions. We introduce the union property which shows that synapses for multiple patterns can be randomly mixed together within a segment and still lead to highly accurate recognition. We describe simulation results that provide overall insight into sparse representations as well as two primary results. First we show that pattern recognition by a neuron can be extremely accurate and robust with high dimensional sparse inputs even when using a tiny number of synapses to recognize large patterns. Second, equations representing recognition accuracy of a dendrite predict optimal NMDA spiking thresholds under a generous set of assumptions. The prediction tightly matches NMDA spiking thresholds measured in the literature. Our model neuron matches many of the known properties of pyramidal neurons. As such the theory provides a unified and practical mathematical framework for understanding the benefits and limits of sparse representations in cortical networks.},

abstract = {The mammalian motor system is organized around distinct subcortical subsystems, suggesting that the intracortical circuits immediately upstream of spinal cord and basal ganglia might be functionally differentiated as well. We found that the main excitatory pathway in mouse motor cortex, layer 2/3-->5, is fractionated into distinct pathways targeting corticospinal and corticostriatal neurons, which are involved in motor control. However, connections were selective for neurons in certain sublayers: corticospinal neurons in upper layer 5B and corticostriatal neurons in lower 5A. A simple structural combinatorial principle accounts for this highly specific functional circuit architecture: potential connectivity is established by neuronal sublayer positioning and actual connectivity in this framework is determined by long-range axonal projection targets. Thus, intracortical circuits of these pyramidal neurons are specified not only by their long-range axonal targets or their layer or sublayer positions, but by both, in specific combinations.},

abstract = {In the field of cortical cellular physiology, much effort has been invested in understanding thick apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons and the regenerative sodium and calcium spikes that take place in the apical trunk. Here we focus on thin dendrites of pyramidal cells (basal, oblique, and tuft dendrites), and we discuss one relatively novel form of an electrical signal ("NMDA spike") that is specific for these branches. Basal, oblique, and apical tuft dendrites receive a high density of glutamatergic synaptic contacts. Synchronous activation of 10-50 neighboring glutamatergic synapses triggers a local dendritic regenerative potential, NMDA spike/plateau, which is characterized by significant local amplitude (40-50 mV) and an extraordinary duration (up to several hundred milliseconds). The NMDA plateau potential, when it is initiated in an apical tuft dendrite, is able to maintain a good portion of that tuft in a sustained depolarized state. However, if NMDA-dominated plateau potentials originate in proximal segments of basal dendrites, they regularly bring the neuronal cell body into a sustained depolarized state, which resembles a cortical Up state. At each dendritic initiation site (basal, oblique, and tuft) an NMDA spike creates favorable conditions for causal interactions of active synaptic inputs, including the spatial or temporal binding of information, as well as processes of short-term and long-term synaptic modifications (e.g., long-term potentiation or long-term depression). Because of their strong amplitudes and durations, local dendritic NMDA spikes make up the cellular substrate for multisite independent subunit computations that enrich the computational power and repertoire of cortical pyramidal cells. We propose that NMDA spikes are likely to play significant roles in cortical information processing in awake animals (spatiotemporal binding, working memory) and during slow-wave sleep (neuronal Up states, consolidation of memories).},

The paper describes evidence for the HTM {\&}quot;predictive state{\&}quot;. A non-apical NMDA spike can depolarize a cell body (page 2998, middle of right column). The time course of this depolarization is interesting - the paper shows evidence for a more sustained depolarization than we typically model in HTMs. This could be used to help combat temporal noise or it could support the {\&}quot;learn on one cell{\&}quot; mode.

abstract = {In several sensory pathways, input stimuli project to sparsely active downstream populations that have more neurons than incoming axons. Here, we address the computational benefits of expansion and sparseness for clustered inputs, where different clusters represent behaviorally distinct stimuli and intracluster variability represents sensory or neuronal noise. Through analytical calculations and numerical simulations, we show that expansion implemented by feed-forward random synaptic weights amplifies variability in the incoming stimuli, and this noise enhancement increases with sparseness of the expanded representation. In addition, the low dimensionality of the input layer generates overlaps between the induced representations of different stimuli, limiting the benefit of expansion. Highly sparse expansive representations obtained through synapses that encode the clustered structure of the input reduce both intrastimulus variability and the excess overlaps between stimuli, enhancing the ability of downstream neurons to perform classification and recognition tasks. Implications for olfactory, cerebellar, and visual processing are discussed.},

abstract = {The term affordance defines a property of objects, which relates to the possible interactions that an agent can carry out on that object. In monkeys, canonical neurons encode both the visual and the motor properties of objects with high specificity. However, it is not clear if in humans exists a similarly fine-grained description of these visuomotor transformations. In particular, it has not yet been proven that the processing of visual features related to specific affordances induces both specific and early visuomotor transformations, given that complete specificity has been reported to emerge quite late (300-450ms). In this study, we applied an adaptation-stimulation paradigm to investigate early cortico-spinal facilitation and hand movements׳ synergies evoked by the observation of tools. We adapted, through passive observation of finger movements, neuronal populations coding either for precision or power grip actions. We then presented the picture of one tool affording one of the two grasps types and applied single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to the hand primary motor cortex, 150ms after image onset. Cortico-spinal excitability of the Abductor Digiti Minimi and Abductor Pollicis Brevis showed a detailed pattern of modulations, matching tools׳ affordances. Similarly, TMS-induced hand movements showed a pattern of grip-specific whole hand synergies. These results offer a direct proof of the emergence of an early visuomotor transformation when tools are observed, that maintains the same amount of synergistic motor details as the actions we can perform on them.},

This paper aims to fill this gap by reviewing existing strategies for multi-step ahead forecasting and comparing them in theoretical and practical terms. To attain such an objective, we performed a large scale comparison of these different strategies using a large experimental benchmark (namely the 111 series from the NN5 forecasting competition). In addition, we considered the effects of deseasonalization, input variable selection, and forecast combination on these strategies and on multi-step ahead forecasting at large. The following three findings appear to be consistently supported by the experimental results: Multiple-Output strategies are the best performing approaches, deseasonalization leads to uniformly improved forecast accuracy, and input selection is more effective when performed in conjunction with deseasonalization.},

We then describe specific spatial pooling and temporal memory implementations, as well as simulations demonstrating that the fundamental properties are maintained. We discuss issues in implementing the full set of plasticity rules using Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP), and rough place and route calculations. Although further work is required, our initial studies indicate that it should be possible to run large-scale HTM networks (including plasticity rules) efficiently on the Heidelberg platform.

The paramedian lobule is activated during limb movements used in both acrobatic training and physical exercise. Acrobatic animals had greater numbers of synapses per Purkinje cell than animals from the exercise or inactive groups. No significant difference in synapse number or size between the exercised and inactive groups was found. This indicates that motor learning required of the acrobatic animals, and not repetitive use of synapses during physical exercise, generates new synapses in cerebellar cortex. In contrast, exercise animals had a greater density of blood vessels in the molecular layer than did either the acrobatic or inactive animals, suggesting that increased synaptic activity elicited compensatory angiogenesis.},

abstract = {The detection and discrimination of temporal sequences is fundamental to brain function and underlies perception, cognition, and motor output. By applying patterned, two-photon glutamate uncaging, we found that single dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons exhibit sensitivity to the sequence of synaptic activation. This sensitivity is encoded by both local dendritic calcium signals and somatic depolarization, leading to sequence-selective spike output. The mechanism involves dendritic impedance gradients and nonlinear synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation and is generalizable to dendrites in different neuronal types. This enables discrimination of patterns delivered to a single dendrite, as well as patterns distributed randomly across the dendritic tree. Pyramidal cell dendrites can thus act as processing compartments for the detection of synaptic sequences, thereby implementing a fundamental cortical computation.},

abstract = {Cortical pyramidal neurons receive thousands of synaptic inputs arriving at different dendritic locations with varying degrees of temporal synchrony. It is not known if different locations along single cortical dendrites integrate excitatory inputs in different ways. Here we have used two-photon glutamate uncaging and compartmental modeling to reveal a gradient of nonlinear synaptic integration in basal and apical oblique dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons. Excitatory inputs to the proximal dendrite sum linearly and require precise temporal coincidence for effective summation, whereas distal inputs are amplified with high gain and integrated over broader time windows. This allows distal inputs to overcome their electrotonic disadvantage, and become surprisingly more effective than proximal inputs at influencing action potential output. Thus, single dendritic branches can already exhibit nonuniform synaptic integration, with the computational strategy shifting from temporal coding to rate coding along the dendrite.},

        Summary of findings:
        

        

        

        
1) Proximal dendrites sum over their synapses linearly. Synapses sum linearly and inputs must converge at the exact same time. They also show that more distal dendritic branches show threshold like (sigmoidal) response properties.  This is nice confirmation for our model.

        

        
2) Distal dendrites have broader temporal integration windows. Quote: {\&}quot;We show that single cortical pyramidal cell dendrites exhibit a gradient of temporal summation and input gain that increases from proximal to distal locations. This suggests a progressive shift of computational strategies for synaptic inputs along single dendrites.”   

        

        
Near the base if inputs are more than a few msecs apart, the evoked potential drops significantly.  Confirmation that proximal dendrites act as coincidence detectors.   Segments farther away from the base can sum over longer temporal intervals.  At the most distal locations, evoked potential stays constant for much longer than 10 msecs.  

        

        
Another way to phrase this is that proximal segments require precise synchrony (coincidence detection), distal segments don’t require such precise timing.

        

        
3) More distal segments have higher gain (sigmoid gain) and require fewer synapses to fire. As a consequence, they also state that really distal segments can be as effective or even more effective than proximal dendrites in driving axonal output.   Not sure what to make of this.

        

        
4) They show all this in Layer 2/3 as well as Layer 5 pyramidal cells.

        

        

        

        Some reactions to temporal property:
        

        

        

        
We don’t model the timing property of distal segments today, but this property could be very useful. For example: 

        

        
Longer temporal scales can be helpful in dealing with temporal noise. A longer scale will make us more resistant to temporal insertions. It could also be used to create connections from a single segment to time steps t-1 and t-2. This will make us more robust to temporal deletions. (This is similar to our previous pooling idea.)

        

        
Distal inputs into L4 can be coming in at different time scales (motor commands could be slower than sensory input). A longer temporal integration period may be necessary for proper sensorimotor inference. 

        

        
If apical dendrites have much larger temporal integration windows, this could be very useful for feedback which necessarily has a slower time scale.

abstract = {Storing and recalling spiking sequences is a general problem the brain needs to solve. It is, however, unclear what type of biologically plausible learning rule is suited to learn a wide class of spatiotemporal activity patterns in a robust way. Here we consider a recurrent network of stochastic spiking neurons composed of both visible and hidden neurons. We derive a generic learning rule that is matched to the neural dynamics by minimizing an upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the target distribution to the model distribution. The derived learning rule is consistent with spike-timing dependent plasticity in that a presynaptic spike preceding a postsynaptic spike elicits potentiation while otherwise depression emerges. Furthermore, the learning rule for synapses that target visible neurons can be matched to the recently proposed voltage-triplet rule. The learning rule for synapses that target hidden neurons is modulated by a global factor, which shares properties with astrocytes and gives rise to testable predictions.},

abstract = {Neuronal activity in the motor cortex is understood to be correlated with movements, but the impact of action potentials (APs) in single cortical neurons on the generation of movement has not been fully determined. Here we show that trains of APs in single pyramidal cells of rat motor cortex can evoke long sequences of small whisker movements. For layer-5 pyramids, we find that evoked rhythmic movements have a constant phase relative to the AP train, indicating that single layer-5 pyramids can reset the rhythm of whisker movements. Action potentials evoked in layer-6 pyramids can generate bursts of rhythmic whisking, with a variable phase of movements relative to the AP train. An increasing number of APs decreases the latency to onset of movement, whereas AP frequency determines movement direction and amplitude. We find that the efficacy of cortical APs in evoking whisker movements is not dependent on background cortical activity and is greatly enhanced in waking rats. We conclude that in vibrissae motor cortex sparse AP activity can evoke movements.},

abstract = {Properties of sequence-sensitive neurons in primary auditory cortex of cats were explored in detail. Stimuli were sequences of two tones, in which the frequency and intensity of the first tone and the temporal separation between the first and second, or probe, tone were parametrically varied. After presentation of the first tone, the responses of 32 single units and 48 multiunits to the probe tone were found to be enhanced up to 140-5270{\%} (median 340{\%}) above the response obtained in the single-tone condition. Probe tone enhancement was induced from a considerable number of sequence conditions and depended on the frequency and intensity of the first tone and on the temporal separation between the onsets of the first and the probe tone. On average, the maximally enhanced response occurred when the first tone was 1 octave below or above the probe tone and its intensity was 14 dB louder than the probe tone. The most effective temporal separation of the tones for an enhancement effect was approximately 100 ms. The range of enhancing tones was largely outside the excitatory tuning curve of a neuron. Results extend previous findings of properties of sequence-sensitive neurons in the auditory cortex of echolocating bats and non-echolocating mammals, and suggest that sequence-sensitive neurons are quite common and involved in the cortical representation of spectrotemporal patterns of acoustic signals.},

However, they display considerable heterogeneity between areas and species, perhaps even within a given macrocolumn.

abstract = {A fundamental paradigm shift is underway in the behavioural neurosciences which promotes renewed discussion of neural correlates of conscious sensation. A growing body of evidence that the primary sensory areas are central to conscious processing is inconsistent with conventional bottom-up models of passive sensory transformation. The new paradigm emphasizes the interaction of top-down corticocortical influences with bottom-up sensory feedback. This review develops the new interactive paradigm with respect to the behaviourally relevant N1 component of the somatosensory evoked response in primary somatosensory neocortex which is only observed during conscious states and predicts touch discrimination behaviour. N1 is generated by layer I excitation apparently in response to backward projections from higher order cortical areas. The backward corticocortical projections mediating top-down influences are anatomically concentrated in layer I where they strongly excite the subpopulation of pyramidal neurons with extensive distal apical dendrites. This subpopulation includes the forward-projecting pyramids subserving corticocortical reentrance as well as the corticobulbar projections mediating cortical control over fine sensory-oriented movements. This interactive paradigm views conscious sensation as an active behaviour with the optimal spatial resolution of primary areas serving as the sensory-motor interface at the major convergence point between reentrant bottom-up and top-down pathways. A device is proposed for the reconstruction of cortical sensory processing based upon the central importance of the primary area as the focus of convergent top-down cortical projections.},

abstract = {Findings from studies using electrical stimulation of cortex, recording from single neurons in awake animals, and measuring regional cerebral blood flow in humans have revealed some specific motor functions for several cerebral cortical areas. These areas include primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, premotor area, parietal areas 5 and 7, and prefrontal area. Execution of movement is a function of the primary motor cortex, which translates program instructions for movement from other parts of the brain into signals. These signals encode variables of movement, such as the muscles to contract and the force and timing of their contraction. Long-latency reflex responses of muscles to stretch and cutaneous stimulation are also mediated by the motor cortex; other motor areas seem to perform higher order motor functions. The supplementary motor area controls input-output coupling in motor cortex and the programming of complex sequences of rapidly occurring discrete movements, such as playing the piano. The premotor area participates in the assembly of new motor programs. The parietal areas 5 and 7 are involved in directing attention to objects of interest in visual space and issuing commands for arm movements and eye movements to these objects. The prefrontal cortex performs cognitive functions, such as short-term memory of correct motor responses in delayed response tests.},

Jeff says on the mailing list:




Classic Hebbian learning is about strengthening synapses, but we are suggesting that new synapses are formed. I think you are asking how this is possible biologically. 
The idea for “potential synapses” comes from a researcher Chklovskii. An axon and dendrite that are near each other but that are not connected can still sense pre- and post-syaptic activity and this is sufficient for them to start to grow a new synapse when they are active at the same time. What is actually is grown is a “spine” that connects the axon and dendrite. The synapse is on the end of the spine. In addition, glial cells have been shown to act as intermediaries. They can encourage a dendrite and axon to move/grow closer together when they fire at the same time. Glial cells effectively increase the number of potential synapses. Finally, the ends of the dendritic and axonal tress are constantly growing I different directions trying to find new useful connections. It is now well known that synapses and spines form during learning and they also disappear. This can happen rapidly, in a matter of minutes in some cases.




I believe the concept of potential synapses and the growth of new synapses applies to both proximal and distal synapses. In our temporal memory implementation we decided to implement it differently purely to make the software more efficient and to use less memory. Instead of maintaining a large pool of potential synapses, most of which would have 0 permanence, we choose from the set of active cells.},

Here we show that different motor learning tasks induce dendritic Ca(2+) spikes on different apical tuft branches of individual layer V pyramidal neurons in the mouse motor cortex. These task-related, branch-specific Ca(2+) spikes cause long-lasting potentiation of postsynaptic dendritic spines active at the time of spike generation. When somatostatin-expressing interneurons are inactivated, different motor tasks frequently induce Ca(2+) spikes on the same branches. On those branches, spines potentiated during one task are depotentiated when they are active seconds before Ca(2+) spikes induced by another task. Concomitantly, increased neuronal activity and performance improvement after learning one task are disrupted when another task is learned. These findings indicate that dendritic-branch-specific generation of Ca(2+) spikes is crucial for establishing long-lasting synaptic plasticity, thereby facilitating information storage associated with different learning experiences.},

- Different motor tasks induced dendritic Calcium spikes on different apical tuft branches of L5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse motor cortex


- Branch specific calcium spikes cause long-lasting potentiation of postsynaptic dendritic spikes that are active at the time of spike generation. But spines active before the dendritic spike are depotentiated. This is conceptually similar to the spike-time-dependent-plasticity (STDP) rule.


- Generation of dendritic spike is regulated by cortical inhibition. When somatostatin expressing interneurons are inactivated, different motor tasks frequently induced calcium spikes on the same spikes. In other words, the spatial segregation of dendritic spike relies on inhibitory neurons.



- Disrupting dendritic spikes leads to impaired motor performance. 


- The branch-specific dendritic calcium spikes is important in storing new information without disrupting existing memories in the brains.},

abstract = {This paper reports the results of the NN3 competition, which is a replication of the M3 competition with an extension of the competition towards neural network (NN) and computational intelligence (CI) methods, in order to assess what progress has been made in the 10 years since the M3 competition. Two masked subsets of the M3 monthly industry data, containing 111 and 11 empirical time series respectively, were chosen, controlling for multiple data conditions of time series length (short/long), data patterns (seasonal/non-seasonal) and forecasting horizons (short/medium/long). The relative forecasting accuracy was assessed using the metrics from the M3, together with later extensions of scaled measures, and non-parametric statistical tests. The NN3 competition attracted 59 submissions from NN, CI and statistics, making it the largest CI competition on time series data. Its main findings include: (a) only one NN outperformed the damped trend using the sMAPE, but more contenders outperformed the AutomatANN of the M3; (b) ensembles of CI approaches performed very well, better than combinations of statistical methods; (c) a novel, complex statistical method outperformed all statistical and CI benchmarks; and (d) for the most difficult subset of short and seasonal series, a methodology employing echo state neural networks outperformed all others. The NN3 results highlight the ability of NN to handle complex data, including short and seasonal time series, beyond prior expectations, and thus identify multiple avenues for future research.},

abstract = {The ability to recognize and predict temporal sequences of sensory inputs is vital for survival in natural environments. Based on many known properties of cortical neurons, a recent study proposed hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) sequence memory as a theoretical framework for sequence learning in the cortex. In this paper, we analyze properties of HTM sequence memory and apply it to various sequence learning and prediction problems. We show the model is able to continuously learn a large number of variable-order temporal sequences using an unsupervised Hebbian-like learning rule. The sparse temporal codes formed by the model can robustly handle branching temporal sequences by maintaining multiple predictions until there is sufficient disambiguating evidence. We compare the HTM sequence memory and other sequence learning algorithms, including the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and long short-term memory (LSTM), on sequence prediction problems with both artificial and real-world data. The HTM model not only achieves comparable or better accuracy than state-of-the-art algorithms, but also exhibits a set of properties that is critical for sequence learning. These properties include continuous online learning, the ability to handle multiple predictions and branching sequences, robustness to sensor noise and fault tolerance, and good performance without task-specific hyper-parameters tuning. Therefore the HTM sequence memory not only advances our understanding of how the brain may solve the sequence learning problem, but is also applicable to a wide range of real-world problems such as discrete and continuous sequence prediction, anomaly detection, and sequence classification.},

We proceed to develop a theory of Bayesian learning in spiking neural networks, where the neurons learn to recognize temporal dynamics of their synaptic inputs. Meanwhile, successive layers of neurons learn hierarchical causal models for the sensory input. The corresponding learning rule is local, spike-time dependent, and highly nonlinear. This approach provides a principled description of spiking and plasticity rules maximizing information transfer, while limiting the number of costly spikes, between successive layers of neurons.},

abstract = {In order to understand the general principles along which sensory processing is organized, several recent studies optimized particular coding objectives on natural inputs for different modalities. The homogeneity of neocortex indicates that a sensitive objective should be able to explain response properties of different sensory modalities. The temporal stability objective was successfully applied to somatosensory and visual processing. We investigate if this objective can also be applied to auditory processing and serves as a general optimization objective for sensory processing. In case of audition, this translates to a set of non-linear complex filters optimized for temporal stability on natural sounds. We show that following this approach we can develop filters that are localized in frequency and time and extract the frequency content of the sound wave. A subset of these filters respond invariant to the phase of the sound. A comparison of the tuning of these filters to the tuning of cat auditory nerves shows a close match. This suggests that temporal stability can be seen as a general objective describing somatosensory, visual and auditory processing.},

abstract = {The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a preattentive component of the auditory event-related potential that is elicited by a change in a repetitive acoustic pattern. While MMN has been extensively used in human electrophysiological studies of auditory processing, the neural mechanisms and brain regions underlying its generation remain unclear. We investigate possible homologs of the MMN in macaque primary auditory cortex (A1) using a frequency oddball paradigm in which rare "deviant" tones are randomly interspersed among frequent "standard" tones. Standards and deviants had frequencies equal to the best frequency (BF) of the recorded neural population or to a frequency that evoked a response half the amplitude of the BF response. Early and later field potentials, current source density components, multiunit activity, and induced high-gamma band responses were larger when elicited by deviants than by standards of the same frequency. Laminar analysis indicated that differences between deviant and standard responses were more prominent in later activity, thus suggesting cortical amplification of initial responses driven by thalamocortical inputs. However, unlike the human MMN, larger deviant responses were characterized by the enhancement of "obligatory" responses rather than the introduction of new components. Furthermore, a control condition wherein deviants were interspersed among many tones of variable frequency replicated the larger responses to deviants under the oddball condition. Results suggest that differential responses under the oddball condition in macaque A1 reflect stimulus-specific adaptation rather than deviance detection per se. We conclude that neural mechanisms of deviance detection likely reside in cortical areas outside of A1.},
annote = {From EEG recordings, people know that unexpected stimulus ({\&}quot;deviant{\&}quot; sounds in this study), will elicit stronger response. This paper studies the neural mechanisms and brain regions underlying this effect in the primary auditory cortex. They confirmed that spiking response were larger when elicited by the unexpected stimulus, and the difference between expected and unexpected stimulus were more prominent in later activity. The unexpected stimulus can be introduced either in a oddball paradigm in which rare deviant tones are randomly interspersed among frequent standard tones (Fig. 1B), or in a random sequence where tone is unexpected (Fig. 1C). 

        

        

        

        
One downside of this study is they used a very simple sequence for the oddball paradigm. It will be more interesting to see whether the same phenomenon holds when they play a more complex tone sequence (an oddball within a melody). They conclude that the difference between unexpected stimulus and repeated expected stimulus is due to stimulus specific adaptation (rather than prediction).

Notably, after V1 was trained to recognize a sequence, cortical activity regenerated the full sequence even when individual stimulus elements were omitted.

In this paper, we describe how Bayesian belief propagation in a spatio-temporal hierarchical model, called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), can lead to a mathematical model for cortical circuits. An HTM node is abstracted using a coincidence detector and a mixture of Markov chains. Bayesian belief propagation equations for such an HTM node define a set of functional constraints for a neuronal implementation. Anatomical data provide a contrasting set of organizational constraints. The combination of these two constraints suggests a theoretically derived interpretation for many anatomical and physiological features and predicts several others. We describe the pattern recognition capabilities of HTM networks and demonstrate the application of the derived circuits for modeling the subjective contour effect. We also discuss how the theory and the circuit can be extended to explain cortical features that are not explained by the current model and describe testable predictions that can be derived from the model.},

Without resets, the state may grow indefinitely and eventually cause the network to break down. Our remedy is a novel, adaptive "forget gate" that enables an LSTM cell to learn to reset itself at appropriate times, thus releasing internal resources. We review illustrative benchmark problems on which standard LSTM outperforms other RNN algorithms. All algorithms (including LSTM) fail to solve continual versions of these problems. LSTM with forget gates, however, easily solves them, and in an elegant way.},

They have been used as powerful computational tools to solve complex pattern recognition, function estimation, and classification problems.

Information transfer in these neurons mimics the information transfer in biological neurons, i.e., via the precise timing of spikes or a sequence of spikes. To facilitate learning in such networks, new learning algorithms based on varying degrees of biological plausibility have also been developed recently. Addition of the temporal dimension for information encoding in SNNs yields new insight into the dynamics of the human brain and could result in compact representations of large neural networks. As such, SNNs have great potential for solving complicated time-dependent pattern recognition problems because of their inherent dynamic representation. This article presents a state-of-the-art review of the development of spiking neurons and SNNs, and provides insight into their evolution as the third generation neural networks.},

abstract = {In CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, calcium-dependent spikes occur in vivo during specific behavioral states and may be enhanced during epileptiform activity. However, the mechanisms that control calcium spike initiation and repolarization are poorly understood. Using dendritic and somatic patch-pipette recordings, we show that calcium spikes are initiated in the apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons and drive bursts of sodium-dependent action potentials at the soma. Initiation of calcium spikes at the soma was suppressed in part by potassium channels activated by sodium-dependent action potentials. Low-threshold, putative D-type potassium channels [blocked by 100 microM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and 0.5-1 microM alpha-dendrotoxin (alpha-DTX)] played a prominent role in setting a high threshold for somatic calcium spikes, thus restricting initiation to the dendrites. DTX- and 4-AP-sensitive channels were activated during sodium-dependent action potentials and mediated a large component of their afterhyperpolarization. Once initiated, repetitive firing of calcium spikes was limited by activation of putative BK-type calcium-activated potassium channels (blocked by 250 microM tetraethylammonium chloride, 70 nM charybdotoxin, or 100 nM iberiotoxin). Thus, the concerted action of calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channels serves to focus spatially and temporally the membrane depolarization and calcium influx generated by calcium spikes during strong, synchronous network excitation.},

Using confocal imaging and dual site focal synaptic stimulation, we show that basal dendrites, which receive the majority of synapses innervating neocortical pyramidal neurons, contain two compartments with respect to plasticity rules. Synapses innervating the proximal basal tree are easily modified when paired with the global activity of the neuron. In contrast, synapses innervating the distal basal tree fail to change in response to global suprathreshold activity or local dendritic spikes. These synapses can undergo long-term potentiation under unusual conditions when local NMDA spikes, which evoke large calcium transients, are paired with a "gating molecule," BDNF. Moreover, these synapses use a new temporal plasticity rule, which is an order of magnitude longer than spike timing dependent plasticity and prefers reversed presynaptic/postsynaptic activation order. The newly described plasticity compartmentalization of basal dendrites expands the networks plasticity rules and may support different learning and developmental functions.},

3. Pairing NMDA spike with a growth factor, BDNF cause LTP of distal synapses. It is not yet known when BDNF is regulated in the brain though.

4. At this condition of 3, plasticity can be triggered even if EPSP is delayed relative to NMDA spike by more than 100 ms, which is much longer than the classical STDP.},

abstract = {Electrical microstimulation was used to study primary motor and premotor cortex in monkeys. Each stimulation train was 500 ms in duration, approximating the time scale of normal reaching and grasping movements and the time scale of the neuronal activity that normally accompanies movement. This stimulation on a behaviorally relevant time scale evoked coordinated, complex postures that involved many joints. For example, stimulation of one site caused the mouth to open and also caused the hand to shape into a grip posture and move to the mouth. Stimulation of this site always drove the joints toward this final posture, regardless of the direction of movement required to reach the posture. Stimulation of other cortical sites evoked different postures. Postures that involved the arm were arranged across cortex to form a map of hand positions around the body. This stimulation-evoked map encompassed both primary motor and the adjacent premotor cortex. We suggest that these regions fit together into a single map of the workspace around the body.},

Fun paper to read. Lots of good references to other papers that stimulated various areas that project to muscle areas, and observed resulting behaviors. Eye saccades, head movements, mating behaviors, feeding behaviors, etc. The duration of stimulation ({\&}quot;stimulation trains{\&}quot;) in these studies have to match the duration of the behavior.
In this paper they stimulated neurons in premotor cortex using {\&}quot;stimulation trains{\&}quot; of 500ms, much longer than previous studies. This allowed complex coordinated movements to unfold. One example stimulation caused the following behavior: left hand closed into a grip, the hand turned towards the face, the elbow and shoulders rotated to bring the hand smoothly to the mouth, and the mouth opened.

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        
Stimulation specified the final position, independent of starting position of the hand/arm. As such, this stimulation represents a {\&}quot;plan{\&}quot; or a {\&}quot;goal state{\&}quot;. Different cells caused different behaviors (another nearby set of cells seem to encode moving the mouth to a particular configuration).

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        
This implies that stimulating the same set of cells in premotor cortex can stimulate different sets of muscles depending on initial configuration. The paper directly verifies this experimentally. They also tested the velocity profiles and found that they exactly matched velocity profiles of normal skilled movements.

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        
They then mapped out hand positions. There is a topographic {\&}quot;map{\&}quot; of hand positions (Figure 5), but these are {\&}quot;goal{\&}quot; positions, not current positions. Stimulating a particular area would cause the monkey to move their hand to that area regardless of initial hand or body position. In some areas the mouth was also involved. In other areas the leg and feet were involved.

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        
This area also receives sensory input from multiple sensory modalities (usually both tactile and visual). They studied the effect of this input. For example, in one location the effect of touch or visual input near the arm, or electrical stimulation in that region, caused the monkey to retract its arm.   All the sensory areas they studied evoked flinching or avoiding behaviors. 

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        
This is clear direct evidence that in premotor cortex we have SDRs representing goal states or high level “motor plans{\&}quot;. These goal states represent desired end configuration of our body. Why is it an SDR? Only a small number of cells are invoked at any time. The rerepsentation is distributed: different cells corresponded to different (sometimes very similar) semantic goals.

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        
How does this SDR lead to actual muscle movements? There must be an associative mapping between current goal SDR, the current configuration (presumably proprioceptive sense) and the desired set of action potentials to the muscles. Presumably this happens in motor cortex and also in lower motor areas. It is not a strict hierarchy since premotor cortex also projects to subcortical motor areas. It may be that layer 5 computes this associative map.

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        

        
One key thing they emphasize is that brief stimulation of these areas only causes muscle twitches. You need to have extended stimulation (500msecs) before you get the complex behaviors.  This is one reason neuroscientists haven’t previously observed this type of reaction in this area.},

In CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons in vivo, such complex spike bursts (CSs) are detected during various behaviors and are considered to be particularly important for learning- and memory-related synaptic plasticity. Here, we combined whole-cell recordings and two-photon imaging in mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons to investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying CSs in vivo. Our results demonstrate that CSs are of synaptic origin, as they require N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation. We identify voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel-dependent, spike-like depolarizations as integral components of the CSs. These Ca(2+) spikes were invariably associated with widespread large-amplitude Ca(2+) transients in basal and apical dendrites. Together, our results reveal a type of NMDA receptor-dependent multidendrite Ca(2+) spike required for high-frequency bursting in vivo.},

There is increasing evidence that dendrites are not just passive transmitting devices but play active roles in synaptic integration through linear and non-linear mechanisms. Frequently, excitatory synapses are formed on dendritic spines. In addition to relaying incoming electrical signals, spines can play important roles in modifying these signals through complex biochemical processes and, thereby, determine learning and memory formation.

abstract = {Most neurons have elaborate dendritic trees that receive tens of thousands of synaptic inputs. Because postsynaptic responses to individual synaptic events are usually small and transient, the integration of many synaptic responses is needed to depolarize most neurons to action potential threshold. Over the past decade, advances in electrical and optical recording techniques have led to new insights into how synaptic responses propagate and interact within dendritic trees. In addition to their passive electrical and morphological properties, dendrites express active conductances that shape individual synaptic responses and influence synaptic integration locally within dendrites. Dendritic voltage-gated Na(+) and Ca(2+) channels support action potential backpropagation into the dendritic tree and local initiation of dendritic spikes, whereas K(+) conductances act to dampen dendritic excitability. While all dendrites investigated to date express active conductances, different neuronal types show specific patterns of dendritic channel expression leading to cell-specific differences in the way synaptic responses are integrated within dendritic trees. This review explores the way active and passive dendritic properties shape synaptic responses in the dendrites of central neurons, and emphasizes their role in synaptic integration.},

Although the computational advantages of spike timing-based neuronal codes have long been recognized, it is unclear whether, and if so how, neurons can learn to read out such representations. We propose a new, biologically plausible supervised synaptic learning rule that enables neurons to efficiently learn a broad range of decision rules, even when information is embedded in the spatiotemporal structure of spike patterns rather than in mean firing rates. The number of categorizations of random spatiotemporal patterns that a neuron can implement is several times larger than the number of its synapses. The underlying nonlinear temporal computation allows neurons to access information beyond single-neuron statistics and to discriminate between inputs on the basis of multineuronal spike statistics. Our work demonstrates the high capacity of neural systems to learn to decode information embedded in distributed patterns of spike synchrony.},

@article{Hawkins2015,
abstract = {Neocortical neurons have thousands of excitatory synapses. It is a mystery how neurons integrate the input from so many synapses and what kind of large-scale network behavior this enables. It has been previously proposed that non-linear properties of dendrites enable neurons to recognize multiple patterns. In this paper we extend this idea by showing that a neuron with several thousand synapses arranged along active dendrites can learn to accurately and robustly recognize hundreds of unique patterns of cellular activity, even in the presence of large amounts of noise and pattern variation. We then propose a neuron model where some of the patterns recognized by a neuron lead to action potentials and define the classic receptive field of the neuron, whereas the majority of the patterns recognized by a neuron act as predictions by slightly depolarizing the neuron without immediately generating an action potential. We then present a network model based on neurons with these properties and show that the network learns a robust model of time-based sequences. Given the similarity of excitatory neurons throughout the neocortex and the importance of sequence memory in inference and behavior, we propose that this form of sequence memory is a universal property of neocortical tissue. We further propose that cellular layers in the neocortex implement variations of the same sequence memory algorithm to achieve different aspects of inference and behavior. The neuron and network models we introduce are robust over a wide range of parameters as long as the network uses a sparse distributed code of cellular activations. The sequence capacity of the network scales linearly with the number of synapses on each neuron. Thus neurons need thousands of synapses to learn the many temporal patterns in sensory stimuli and motor sequences.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a mechanism which the neocortex may use to store sequences of patterns. Storing and recalling sequences are necessary for making predictions, recognizing time-based patterns and generating behaviour. Since these tasks are major functions of the neocortex, the ability to store and recall time-based sequences is probably a key attribute of many, if not all, cortical areas. Previously, we have proposed that the neocortex can be modelled as a hierarchy of memory regions, each of which learns and recalls sequences. This paper proposes how each region of neocortex might learn the sequences necessary for this theory. The basis of the proposal is that all the cells in a cortical column share bottom-up receptive field properties, but individual cells in a column learn to represent unique incidences of the bottom-up receptive field property within different sequences. We discuss the proposal, the biological constraints that led to it and some results modelling it.},

However, the original edition has been unavailable since 1966, ensuring that Hebb's comment that a classic normally means "cited but not read" is true in his case. This new edition rectifies a long-standing problem for behavioral neuroscientists-the inability to obtain one of the most cited publications in the field. The Organization of Behavior played a significant part in stimulating the investigation of the neural foundations of behavior and continues to be inspiring because it provides a general framework for relating behavior to synaptic organization through the dynamics of neural networks. D.O. Hebb was also the first to examine the mechanisms by which environment and experience can influence brain structure and function, and his ideas formed the basis for work on enriched environments as stimulants for behavioral development. References to Hebb, the Hebbian cell assembly, the Hebb synapse, and the Hebb rule increase each year. These forceful ideas of 1949 are now applied in engineering, robotics, and computer science, as well as neurophysiology, neuroscience, and psychology-a tribute to Hebb's foresight in developing a foundational neuropsychological theory of the organization of behavior.},

Here is a classic paper (that I discovered recently, thanks to a friend).

Experiment: two groups of kittens. One group (group A) saw a set of visual stimuli and was allowed to move around. The visual stimuli they saw was a result of their own movement. The second group (group B) saw the same visual stimuli but was not allowed to move around. In particular, group B saw the visual stimuli produced by group A’s movements. They achieved this by attaching pairs of kittens together in a gondola contraption. See Figure 1. (Note: kittens in group B were free to move around, but these motions did not result in sensory changes.)

After group B was free to run around, they did fine.

Indeed, long-term in vivo imaging studies are beginning to reveal the structural dynamics of neocortical neurons in the normal and injured adult brain. Although the overall cell-specific morphology of axons and dendrites, as well as of a subpopulation of small synaptic structures, are remarkably stable, there is increasing evidence that experience-dependent plasticity of specific circuits in the somatosensory and visual cortex involves cell type-specific structural plasticity: some boutons and dendritic spines appear and disappear, accompanied by synapse formation and elimination, respectively. This Review focuses on recent evidence for such structural forms of synaptic plasticity in the mammalian cortex and outlines open questions.},

abstract = {Metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu5) receptors have been recently implicated in prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent executive functions because inhibition of mGlu5 receptors impairs working memory and worsens cognitive-impairing effects of NMDA receptor antagonists. To better understand the mechanisms by which mGlu5 receptors influence PFC function, we examined the effects of selective mGlu5 receptor antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), given alone or in combination with the NMDA receptor antagonist MK801, on ensemble single unit activity in the medial PFC (mPFC) of behaving rats. MPEP decreased the spontaneous burst activity of the majority of mPFC neurons. This inhibition was selective for the most active cells because greater decreases were observed in neurons with higher baseline firing rates. MPEP augmented the effects of MK801 on burst activity, variability of spike firing and random spike activity. These findings demonstrate that in awake animals mGlu5 receptors regulate the function of PFC neurons by two related mechanisms: (i) rate-dependent excitatory influence on spontaneous burst activity; and (ii) potentiation of NMDA receptor mediated effects on firing rate and burst activity. These mechanisms support the idea that modulation of mGlu5 receptors may provide a pharmacological strategy for fine-tuning the temporal pattern of firing of PFC neurons.},

abstract = {This year, the field of neuroscience celebrates the 50th anniversary of Mountcastle's discovery of the cortical column. In this review, we summarize half a century of research and come to the disappointing realization that the column may have no function. Originally, it was described as a discrete structure, spanning the layers of the somatosensory cortex, which contains cells responsive to only a single modality, such as deep joint receptors or cutaneous receptors. Subsequently, examples of columns have been uncovered in numerous cortical areas, expanding the original concept to embrace a variety of different structures and principles. A "column" now refers to cells in any vertical cluster that share the same tuning for any given receptive field attribute. In striate cortex, for example, cells with the same eye preference are grouped into ocular dominance columns. Unaccountably, ocular dominance columns are present in some species, but not others. In principle, it should be possible to determine their function by searching for species differences in visual performance that correlate with their presence or absence. Unfortunately, this approach has been to no avail; no visual faculty has emerged that appears to require ocular dominance columns. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that the expression of ocular dominance columns can be highly variable among members of the same species, or even in different portions of the visual cortex in the same individual. These observations deal a fatal blow to the idea that ocular dominance columns serve a purpose. More broadly, the term "column" also denotes the periodic termination of anatomical projections within or between cortical areas. In many instances, periodic projections have a consistent relationship with some architectural feature, such as the cytochrome oxidase patches in V1 or the stripes in V2. These tissue compartments appear to divide cells with different receptive field properties into distinct processing streams. However, it is unclear what advantage, if any, is conveyed by this form of columnar segregation. Although the column is an attractive concept, it has failed as a unifying principle for understanding cortical function. Unravelling the organization of the cerebral cortex will require a painstaking description of the circuits, projections and response properties peculiar to cells in each of its various areas.},

In 1995, the properties of these interneurons were completely unknown. Twenty years later, thanks to the massive use of subcellular patch-clamp techniques, simultaneous multiple-cell recording, optogenetics, in vivo measurements, and computational approaches, our knowledge about PV(+) interneurons became more extensive than for several types of pyramidal neurons. These findings have implications beyond the "small world" of basic research on GABAergic cells. For example, the results provide a first proof of principle that neuroscientists might be able to close the gaps between the molecular, cellular, network, and behavioral levels, representing one of the main challenges at the present time. Furthermore, the results may form the basis for PV(+) interneurons as therapeutic targets for brain disease in the future. However, much needs to be learned about the basic function of these interneurons before clinical neuroscientists will be able to use PV(+) interneurons for therapeutic purposes.},

We show (1) that temporal association learning provides appropriate invariance in models of object recognition inspired by the visual cortex, (2) that we can replicate the "invariance disruption" experiments using these models with a temporal association learning rule to develop and maintain invariance, and (3) that despite dramatic single cell effects, a population of cells is very robust to these disruptions.

abstract = {Cognitive deficits associated with frontal lobe dysfunction are a determinant of long-term disability in schizophrenia and are not effectively treated with available medications. Clinical studies show that many aspects of these deficits are transiently induced in healthy individuals treated with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists. These findings and recent genetic linkage studies strongly implicate NMDA receptor deficiency in schizophrenia and suggest that reversing this deficiency is pertinent to treating the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Despite the wealth of behavioral data on the effects of NMDA antagonist treatment in humans and laboratory animals, there is a fundamental lack of understanding about the mechanisms by which a general state of NMDA deficiency influences the function of cortical neurons. Using ensemble recording in freely moving rats, we found that NMDA antagonist treatment, at doses that impaired working memory, potentiated the firing rate of most prefrontal cortex neurons. This potentiation, which correlated with expression of behavioral stereotypy, resulted from an increased number of irregularly discharged single spikes. Concurrent with the increase in spike activity, there was a significant reduction in organized bursting activity. These results identify two distinct mechanisms by which NMDA receptor deficiency may disrupt frontal lobe function: an increase in disorganized spike activity, which may enhance cortical noise and transmission of disinformation; and a decrease in burst activity, which reduces transmission efficacy of cortical neurons. These findings provide a physiological basis for the NMDA receptor deficiency model of schizophrenia and may clarify the nature of cortical dysfunction in this disease.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Hippocampal activity is fundamental for episodic memory formation and consolidation. During phases of rest and sleep, it exhibits sharp-wave/ripple (SPW/R) complexes, which are short episodes of increased activity with superimposed high-frequency oscillations. Simultaneously, spike sequences reflecting previous behavior, such as traversed trajectories in space, are replayed. Whereas these phenomena are thought to be crucial for the formation and consolidation of episodic memory, their neurophysiological mechanisms are not well understood. Here we present a unified model showing how experience may be stored and thereafter replayed in association with SPW/Rs. We propose that replay and SPW/Rs are tightly interconnected as they mutually generate and support each other. The underlying mechanism is based on the nonlinear dendritic computation attributable to dendritic sodium spikes that have been prominently found in the hippocampal regions CA1 and CA3, where SPW/Rs and replay are also generated. Besides assigning SPW/Rs a crucial role for replay and thus memory processing, the proposed mechanism also explains their characteristic features, such as the oscillation frequency and the overall wave form. The results shed a new light on the dynamical aspects of hippocampal circuit learning. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: During phases of rest and sleep, the hippocampus, the "memory center" of the brain, generates intermittent patterns of strongly increased overall activity with high-frequency oscillations, the so-called sharp-wave/ripples. We investigate their role in learning and memory processing. They occur together with replay of activity sequences reflecting previous behavior. Developing a unifying computational model, we propose that both phenomena are tightly linked, by mutually generating and supporting each other. The underlying mechanism depends on nonlinear amplification of synchronous inputs that has been prominently found in the hippocampus. Besides assigning sharp-wave/ripples a crucial role for replay generation and thus memory processing, the proposed mechanism also explains their characteristic features, such as the oscillation frequency and the overall wave form.},

abstract = {Patch-clamp recording from dendrites has lead to a significant increase in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying signal integration and propagation in neurons. The majority of synaptic input to neurons, however, is made onto small-diameter dendrites, currently beyond the scope of patch-clamp recording techniques. Here we use both calcium and voltage imaging to investigate propagation of action potentials (APs) in fine basal dendrites of cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons. High-frequency (200 Hz) AP bursts caused supralinear increases in dendritic calcium at distal, but not proximal, basal locations. Supralinear increases in dendritic calcium were also observed at distal basal locations during AP trains above a critical frequency (approximately 100 Hz). Using voltage imaging, we show that single APs undergo significant attenuation as they propagate into basal dendrites, whereas AP bursts lead to generation of dendritic calcium spikes. Focal and bath application of 4-AP increased the amplitude of calcium transients evoked by APs at distal, but not proximal, locations, suggesting that A-type potassium channels regulate AP backpropagation into basal dendrites. Finally, we show that pairing EPSPs with AP bursts is an effective means of activating synaptic NMDA receptors in basal dendrites. The experimental observations on the role of A-type potassium channels in regulation of AP backpropagation in basal dendrites, as well as the generation of dendritic calcium spikes during AP bursts, were reproduced in a morphologically realistic neuronal model with uniform distributions of dendritic sodium, calcium, and potassium channels. Together, these findings have important implications for understanding dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity in cortical basal dendrites.},

abstract = {In spite of recent progress in brain sciences, the local circuit of the cerebral neocortex, including motor areas, still remains elusive. Morphological works on excitatory cortical circuitry from thalamocortical (TC) afferents to corticospinal neurons (CSNs) in motor-associated areas are reviewed here. First, TC axons of motor thalamic nuclei have been re-examined by the single-neuron labeling method. There are middle layer (ML)-targeting and layer (L) 1-preferring TC axon types in motor-associated areas, being analogous to core and matrix types, respectively, of Jones (1998) in sensory areas. However, the arborization of core-like motor TC axons spreads widely and disregards the columnar structure that is the basis of information processing in sensory areas, suggesting that motor areas adopt a different information-processing framework such as area-wide laminar organization. Second, L5 CSNs receive local excitatory inputs not only from L2/3 pyramidal neurons but also from ML spiny neurons, the latter directly processing cerebellar information of core-like TC neurons (TCNs). In contrast, basal ganglia information is targeted to apical dendrites of L2/3 and L5 pyramidal neurons through matrix TCNs. Third, L6 corticothalamic neurons (CTNs) are most densely innervated by ML spiny neurons located just above CTNs. Since CTNs receive only weak connections from L2/3 and L5 pyramidal neurons, the TC recurrent circuit composed of TCNs, ML spiny neurons and CTNs appears relatively independent of the results of processing in L2/3 and L5. It is proposed that two circuits sharing the same TC projection and ML neurons are embedded in the neocortex: one includes L2/3 and L5 neurons, processes afferent information in a feedforward way and sends the processed information to other cortical areas and subcortical regions; and the other circuit participates in a dynamical system of the TC recurrent circuit and may serve as the basis of autonomous activity of the neocortex.},

abstract = {Studies in anesthetized animals have suggested that activity in early visual cortex is mainly driven by visual input and is well described by a feedforward processing hierarchy. However, evidence from experiments on awake animals has shown that both eye movements and behavioral state can strongly modulate responses of neurons in visual cortex; the functional significance of this modulation, however, remains elusive. Using visual-flow feedback manipulations during locomotion in a virtual reality environment, we found that responses in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex are strongly driven by locomotion and by mismatch between actual and expected visual feedback. These data suggest that processing in visual cortex may be based on predictive coding strategies that use motor-related and visual input to detect mismatches between predicted and actual visual feedback.},

abstract = {Although the lifelong addition of new neurons to the olfactory bulb and dentate gyrus of mammalian brains is by now an accepted fact, the function of adult-generated neurons still largely remains a mystery. The ability of new neurons to form synapses with preexisting neurons without disrupting circuit function is central to the hypothesized role of adult neurogenesis as a substrate for learning and memory. With the development of several new genetic labeling and imaging techniques, the study of synapse development and integration of these new neurons into mature circuits both in vitro and in vivo is rapidly advancing our insight into their structural plasticity. Investigators' observation of synaptogenesis occurring in the adult brain is beginning to shed light on the flexibility that adult neurogenesis offers to mature circuits and the potential contribution of the transient plasticity that new neurons provide toward circuit refinement and adaptation to changing environmental demands.},

abstract = {Brief bursts of high-frequency action potentials represent a common firing mode of pyramidal neurons, and there are indications that they represent a special neural code. It is therefore of interest to determine whether there are particular spatial and temporal features of neuronal inputs that trigger bursts. Recent work on pyramidal cells indicates that bursts can be initiated by a specific spatial arrangement of inputs in which there is coincident proximal and distal dendritic excitation (Larkum et al., 1999). Here we have used a computational model of an important class of bursting neurons to investigate whether there are special temporal features of inputs that trigger bursts. We find that when a model pyramidal neuron receives sinusoidally or randomly varying inputs, bursts occur preferentially on the positive slope of the input signal. We further find that the number of spikes per burst can signal the magnitude of the slope in a graded manner. We show how these computations can be understood in terms of the biophysical mechanism of burst generation. There are several examples in the literature suggesting that bursts indeed occur preferentially on positive slopes (Guido et al., 1992; Gabbiani et al., 1996). Our results suggest that this selectivity could be a simple consequence of the biophysics of burst generation. Our observations also raise the possibility that neurons use a burst duration code useful for rapid information transmission. This possibility could be further examined experimentally by looking for correlations between burst duration and stimulus variables.},

abstract = {Our mental representation of object categories is hierarchically organized, and our rapid and seemingly effortless categorization ability is crucial for our daily behavior. Here, we examine responses of a large number (>600) of neurons in monkey inferior temporal (IT) cortex with a large number (>1,000) of natural and artificial object images. During the recordings, the monkeys performed a passive fixation task. We found that the categorical structure of objects is represented by the pattern of activity distributed over the cell population. Animate and inanimate objects created distinguishable clusters in the population code. The global category of animate objects was divided into bodies, hands, and faces. Faces were divided into primate and nonprimate faces, and the primate-face group was divided into human and monkey faces. Bodies of human, birds, and four-limb animals clustered together, whereas lower animals such as fish, reptile, and insects made another cluster. Thus the cluster analysis showed that IT population responses reconstruct a large part of our intuitive category structure, including the global division into animate and inanimate objects, and further hierarchical subdivisions of animate objects. The representation of categories was distributed in several respects, e.g., the similarity of response patterns to stimuli within a category was maintained by both the cells that maximally responded to the category and the cells that responded weakly to the category. These results advance our understanding of the nature of the IT neural code, suggesting an inherently categorical representation that comprises a range of categories including the amply investigated face category.},

They use many different distance methods, though only one is really shown in detail. 








The selectivity of single cells was imperfect compared to cell population as a whole. Many cells discriminated between combinations of categories. In other words it is a distributed representation. 








They showed that lower level simple and complex features (roughly equivalent to V1, V2) cannot account for these similarity metrics.

This is due to an increase in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses found on spines. Four days after stimulation, the inhibitory inputs to the spines remain despite total synaptic density returning to pre-stimulation levels. Functional analysis of layer IV cells demonstrated altered response properties, immediately after stimulation, as well as four days later.

Here, a hypothesis is presented that the extraordinary performance of the cortex derives from an associative mechanism built in at the cellular level to the basic cortical neuronal unit: the pyramidal cell. The mechanism is robustly triggered by coincident input to opposite poles of the neuron, is exquisitely matched to the large- and fine-scale architecture of the cortex, and is tightly controlled by local microcircuits of inhibitory neurons targeting subcellular compartments. This article explores the experimental evidence and the implications for how the cortex operates.},
annote = {To this point, this article has dealt with the biophysical evidence for the existence of an associative firing mechanism in pyramidal neurons and its influence on the input/ output function. This degree of integration between the micro- and macroarchitecture, as well as inbuilt complexity at the cellular level, invites speculation about whether and how the whole system utilizes this feature. The importance of this mechanism conceptually is that the pyramidal neuron is able to detect coincident input to proximal and distal dendritic regions, investing the cortex with an inbuilt associative mechanism at the cellular level for combining feed-forward and feedback information.








:
The BAC firing hypothesis presented here offers a cellular mechanism that addresses a number of questions about the cortex. It suggests that the pyramidal neuron cell type is an associative element which carries out the same essential task at all cortical stages: that of coupling feed-forward and feedback information at the cellular level.












Feedback input to apical dendrites by themselves can cause strong action potentials. If it is coincident with matching feed forward input, the cell bursting can be sustained for a period of time. This can happen if apical input is coincident with matching feed forward input. Mechanisms for that are reviewed. Figure 3a is an example of this.

Dendrites are endowed with mechanisms of nonlinear summation of synaptic inputs leading to regenerative dendritic events including local sodium, NMDA and calcium spikes. The generation of these events requires distinct spatio-temporal activation patterns of synaptic inputs. We hypothesise that the recent findings on dendritic spikes and local synaptic plasticity rules suggest clustering of common inputs along a subregion of a dendritic branch. These clusters may enable dendrites to separately threshold groups of functionally similar inputs, thus allowing single neurons to act as a superposition of many separate integrate and fire units.

We report the existence of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) spikes in the fine distal tuft dendrites that otherwise did not support the initiation of calcium spikes. Both direct measurements and computer simulations showed that NMDA spikes are the dominant mechanism by which distal synaptic input leads to firing of the neuron and provide the substrate for complex parallel processing of top-down input arriving at the tuft. These data lead to a new unifying view of integration in pyramidal neurons in which all fine dendrites, basal and tuft, integrate inputs locally through the recruitment of NMDA receptor channels relative to the fixed apical calcium and axosomatic sodium integration points.},

abstract = {Pyramidal neurons in layer 5 of the neocortex of the brain extend their axons and dendrites into all layers. They are also unusual in having both an axonal and a dendritic zone for the initiation of action potentials. Distal dendritic inputs, which normally appear greatly attenuated at the axon, must cross a high threshold at the dendritic initiation zone to evoke calcium action potentials but can then generate bursts of axonal action potentials. Here we show that a single back-propagating sodium action potential generated in the axon facilitates the initiation of these calcium action potentials when it coincides with distal dendritic input within a time window of several milliseconds. Inhibitory dendritic input can selectively block the initiation of dendritic calcium action potentials, preventing bursts of axonal action potentials. Thus, excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials arising in the distal dendrites can exert significantly greater control over action potential initiation in the axon than would be expected from their electrotonically isolated locations. The coincidence of a single back-propagating action potential with a subthreshold distal excitatory postsynaptic potential to evoke a burst of axonal action potentials represents a new mechanism by which the main cortical output neurons can associate inputs arriving at different cortical layers.},

abstract = {Layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons are the most abundant cells of the neocortex. Despite their key position in the cortical microcircuit, synaptic integration in dendrites of L2/3 neurons is far less understood than in L5 pyramidal cell dendrites, mainly because of the difficulties in obtaining electrical recordings from thin dendrites. Here we directly measured passive and active properties of the apical dendrites of L2/3 neurons in rat brain slices using dual dendritic-somatic patch-clamp recordings and calcium imaging. Unlike L5 cells, L2/3 dendrites displayed little sag in response to long current pulses, which suggests a low density of I(h) in the dendrites and soma. This was also consistent with a slight increase in input resistance with distance from the soma. Brief current injections into the apical dendrite evoked relatively short (half-width 2-4 ms) dendritic spikes that were isolated from the soma for near-threshold currents at sites beyond the middle of the apical dendrite. Regenerative dendritic potentials and large concomitant calcium transients were also elicited by trains of somatic action potentials (APs) above a critical frequency (130 Hz), which was slightly higher than in L5 neurons. Initiation of dendritic spikes was facilitated by backpropagating somatic APs and could cause an additional AP at the soma. As in L5 neurons, we found that distal dendritic calcium transients are sensitive to a long-lasting block by GABAergic inhibition. We conclude that L2/3 pyramidal neurons can generate dendritic spikes, sharing with L5 pyramidal neurons fundamental properties of dendritic excitability and control by inhibition.},

abstract = {Much of the world's data is streaming, time-series data, where anomalies give significant information in critical situations; examples abound in domains such as finance, IT, security, medical, and energy. Yet detecting anomalies in streaming data is a difficult task, requiring detectors to process data in real-time, not batches, and learn while simultaneously making predictions. There are no benchmarks to adequately test and score the efficacy of real-time anomaly detectors. Here we propose the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), which attempts to provide a controlled and repeatable environment of open-source tools to test and measure anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. The perfect detector would detect all anomalies as soon as possible, trigger no false alarms, work with real-world time-series data across a variety of domains, and automatically adapt to changing statistics. Rewarding these characteristics is formalized in NAB, using a scoring algorithm designed for streaming data. NAB evaluates detectors on a benchmark dataset with labeled, real-world time-series data. We present these components, and give results and analyses for several open source, commercially-used algorithms. The goal for NAB is to provide a standard, open source framework with which the research community can compare and evaluate different algorithms for detecting anomalies in streaming data.},

abstract = {It has been conjectured that nonlinear processing in dendritic branches endows individual neurons with the capability to perform complex computational operations that are needed to solve for example the binding problem. However, it is not clear how single neurons could acquire such functionality in a self-organized manner, because most theoretical studies of synaptic plasticity and learning concentrate on neuron models without nonlinear dendritic properties. In the meantime, a complex picture of information processing with dendritic spikes and a variety of plasticity mechanisms in single neurons has emerged from experiments. In particular, new experimental data on dendritic branch strength potentiation in rat hippocampus have not yet been incorporated into such models. In this article, we investigate how experimentally observed plasticity mechanisms, such as depolarization-dependent spike-timing-dependent plasticity and branch-strength potentiation, could be integrated to self-organize nonlinear neural computations with dendritic spikes. We provide a mathematical proof that, in a simplified setup, these plasticity mechanisms induce a competition between dendritic branches, a novel concept in the analysis of single neuron adaptivity. We show via computer simulations that such dendritic competition enables a single neuron to become member of several neuronal ensembles and to acquire nonlinear computational capabilities, such as the capability to bind multiple input features. Hence, our results suggest that nonlinear neural computation may self-organize in single neurons through the interaction of local synaptic and dendritic plasticity mechanisms.},

Neurons at the highest cortical stage of the primate ventral visual stream (inferior temporal cortex; IT) likely underlie the ability of the visual system to tolerate that image variation -- their responses are selective to different objects, yet tolerant (“invariant”) to changes in object position, scale, pose, etc. (1-6). Understanding object recognition will require solving the mystery of how the brain constructs this neuronal tolerance. Here we report a novel instance of neuronal learning that suggests the underlying solution. Specifically, we show that targeted alteration of the natural temporal contiguity of unsupervised visual experience causes specific changes in the position tolerance (“invariance”) of IT neuronal selectivity. This unsupervised temporal tolerance learning (UTL) is substantial, increases with experience, and is significant even in single IT neurons after just one hour. Coupled with previous theoretical work (7-9) and the finding that this same experience manipulation changes the position tolerance of human object perception (10), we speculate that UTL may reflect the mechanism by which the ventral visual stream builds and maintains tolerant object representations. The relatively fast time-scale and unsupervised nature of UTL open the door to advances in systematically characterizing the spatiotemporal image statistics that drive it, understanding if it plays a role in other types of tolerance, and perhaps connecting a central cognitive ability -- tolerant object recognition -- to cellular and molecular plasticity mechanisms.},
annote = {They found neurons in monkey IT that responded strongly to a particular object “P” (preferred) and moderately to another “N” (non-preferred). Tested position tolerance of these objects to get a baseline.  The difference between the responses to “P” and “N” is the “selectivity” for this neuron.  They did this for about 100 neurons in two monkeys, and many different objects.








They then altered temporal contiguity of stimuli and tested the effects on these invariant representations. 








In the experiment, monkeys viewed altered stimuli for several hours. Basically there were three positions for each object: centered, 3’ above and below. For a given P object, the position above or below was designated the “swap” position. As eyes moved around, a P object would be shown in the swap position but was was replaced by the N object during saccade. (Each saccade lasts 23 msecs.) This would happen every time P object was shown in the swap position.  A P object in the non-swap position didn’t change when the money saccaded. (The swap position was randomly changed for different objects.)  The monkey is effectively blind during a saccade, so they don’t see the change - they just see the new object after fixation.








Their prediction: invariance selectivity at swap position would change. Selectivity in the non-swap position won’t change.  This is what happened. At swap position cells did not discriminate as well between P and N. Neuron became more responsive to N and less responsive to P, but only at that location. Change was location specific and shape specific, so very specific to this particular invariance. These changes cannot be explained by attention affects or retinotopic adaptation (everything was counter balanced). 








However another paper of theirs seemed to indicate that temporal contiguity alone was not enough. Looks like eye movements may also be required (this is their reference 10 - Cox and DiCarlo, 2005. Attached paper 2).








They call this effect “Unsupervised temporal tolerance learning” or UTL. This is just temporal pooling for us.  The behavior they describe is exactly the pooling behavior we would expect in layer 3.},

abstract = {Countless learning tasks require dealing with sequential data. Image captioning, speech synthesis, and music generation all require that a model produce outputs that are sequences. In other domains, such as time series prediction, video analysis, and musical information retrieval, a model must learn from inputs that are sequences. Interactive tasks, such as translating natural language, engaging in dialogue, and controlling a robot, often demand both capabilities. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dynamics of sequences via cycles in the network of nodes. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, recurrent networks retain a state that can represent information from an arbitrarily long context window. Although recurrent neural networks have traditionally been difficult to train, and often contain millions of parameters, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful large-scale learning with them. In recent years, systems based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional (BRNN) architectures have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on tasks as varied as image captioning, language translation, and handwriting recognition. In this survey, we review and synthesize the research that over the past three decades first yielded and then made practical these powerful learning models. When appropriate, we reconcile conflicting notation and nomenclature. Our goal is to provide a self-contained explication of the state of the art together with a historical perspective and references to primary research.},

abstract = {Dynamic remodeling of connectivity is a fundamental feature of neocortical circuits. Unraveling the principles underlying these dynamics is essential for the understanding of how neuronal circuits give rise to computations. Moreover, as complete descriptions of the wiring diagram in cortical tissues are becoming available, deciphering the dynamic elements in these diagrams is crucial for relating them to cortical function. Here, we used chronic in vivo two-photon imaging to longitudinally follow a few thousand dendritic spines in the mouse auditory cortex to study the determinants of these spines' lifetimes. We applied nonlinear regression to quantify the independent contribution of spine age and several morphological parameters to the prediction of the future survival of a spine. We show that spine age, size, and geometry are parameters that can provide independent contributions to the prediction of the longevity of a synaptic connection. In addition, we use this framework to emulate a serial sectioning electron microscopy experiment and demonstrate how incorporation of morphological information of dendritic spines from a single time-point allows estimation of future connectivity states. The distinction between predictable and nonpredictable connectivity changes may be used in the future to identify the specific adaptations of neuronal circuits to environmental changes. The full dataset is publicly available for further analysis. Significance statement: The neural architecture in the neocortex exhibits constant remodeling. The functional consequences of these modifications are poorly understood, in particular because the determinants of these changes are largely unknown. Here, we aimed to identify those modifications that are predictable from current network state. To that goal, we repeatedly imaged thousands of dendritic spines in the auditory cortex of mice to assess the morphology and lifetimes of synaptic connections. We developed models based on morphological features of dendritic spines that allow predicting future turnover of synaptic connections. The dynamic models presented in this paper provide a quantitative framework for adding putative temporal dynamics to the static description of a neuronal circuit from single time-point connectomics experiments.},

We have used multisite two-photon glutamate uncaging to deliver different spatiotemporal input patterns to single branches while simultaneously recording the uncaging-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials and local Ca2+ signals. Asynchronous input patterns sum linearly in spite of the spatial clustering and produce Ca2+ signals that are mediated by NMDA receptors (NMDARs). Appropriately timed and sized input patterns ( approximately 20 inputs within approximately 6 ms) produce a supralinear summation due to the initiation of a dendritic spike. The Ca2+ signals associated with synchronous input were larger and mediated by influx through both NMDARs and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs). The oblique spike is a fast Na+ spike whose duration is shaped by the coincident activation of NMDAR, VGCCs, and transient K+ currents. Our results suggest that individual branches can function as single integrative compartments.},

abstract = {Although information storage in the central nervous system is thought to be primarily mediated by various forms of synaptic plasticity, other mechanisms, such as modifications in membrane excitability, are available. Local dendritic spikes are nonlinear voltage events that are initiated within dendritic branches by spatially clustered and temporally synchronous synaptic input. That local spikes selectively respond only to appropriately correlated input allows them to function as input feature detectors and potentially as powerful information storage mechanisms. However, it is currently unknown whether any effective form of local dendritic spike plasticity exists. Here we show that the coupling between local dendritic spikes and the soma of rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons can be modified in a branch-specific manner through an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent regulation of dendritic Kv4.2 potassium channels. These data suggest that compartmentalized changes in branch excitability could store multiple complex features of synaptic input, such as their spatio-temporal correlation. We propose that this 'branch strength potentiation' represents a previously unknown form of information storage that is distinct from that produced by changes in synaptic efficacy both at the mechanistic level and in the type of information stored.},

This requires a coupling between segment activity and later activity at the soma.   This is a fairly strong and specific prediction of HTM learning rules. 

This paper seems to be the first demonstrated evidence for this type of plasticity rule. First they show that there is branch (segment) specific potentiation (learning), isolated from other branches. Second, they show that the branch specific potentiation requires a back action potential.},

A concrete biologically relevant function is exhibited which can be computed by a single spiking neuron (for biologically reasonable values of its parameters), but which requires hundreds of hidden units on a sigmoidal neural net.

We present a simplified working-model biophysical scheme of pyramidal neurons that attempts to capture the essence of their dendritic function, including the ability to behave under plausible conditions as dynamic computational subunits. We emphasize the electrogenic capabilities of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) because these transmitter-gated channels seem to provide the major nonlinear depolarizing drive in thin dendrites, even allowing full-blown NMDA spikes. We show how apparent discrepancies in experimental findings can be reconciled and discuss the current status of dendritic spikes in vivo; a dominant NMDAR contribution would indicate that the input-output relations of thin dendrites are dynamically set by network activity and cannot be fully predicted by purely reductionist approaches.},

abstract = {Glutamatergic inputs clustered over approximately 20-40 microm can elicit local N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) spike/plateau potentials in terminal dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons, inspiring the notion that a single terminal dendrite can function as a decision-making computational subunit. A typical terminal basal dendrite is approximately 100-200 microm long: could it function as multiple decision-making subunits? We test this by sequential focal stimulation of multiple sites along terminal basal dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in rat somatosensory cortical brain slices, using iontophoresis or uncaging of brief glutamate pulses. There was an approximately sevenfold spatial gradient in average spike/plateau amplitude measured at the soma, from approximately 3 mV for distal inputs to approximately 23 mV for proximal inputs. Spike/plateaus were NMDA receptor (NMDAR) conductance-dominated at all locations. Large Ca(2+) transients accompanied spike/plateaus over a approximately 10- to 40-microm zone around the input site; smaller Ca(2+) transients extended approximately uniformly to the dendritic tip. Spike/plateau duration grew with increasing glutamate and depolarization; high Ca(2+) zone size grew with spike/plateau duration. The minimum high Ca(2+) zone half-width (just above NMDA spike threshold) increased from distal (approximately 10 microm) to proximal locations (approximately 25 microm), as did the NMDA spike glutamate threshold. Depolarization reduced glutamate thresholds. Simulations exploring multi-site interactions based on this demonstrate that if appropriately timed and localized inputs occur in vivo, a single basal dendrite could correspond to a cascade of multiple co-operating dynamic decision-making subunits able to retain information for hundreds of milliseconds, with increasing influence on neural output from distal to proximal. Dendritic NMDA spike/plateaus are thus well-suited to support graded persistent firing.},

abstract = {Theories have proposed that, in sensory cortices, learning can enhance top-down modulation by higher brain areas while reducing bottom-up sensory drives. To address circuit mechanisms underlying this process, we examined the activity of layer 2/3 (L2/3) excitatory neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) as well as L4 excitatory neurons, the main bottom-up source, and long-range top-down projections from the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) during associative learning over days using chronic two-photon calcium imaging. During learning, L4 responses gradually weakened, whereas RSC inputs became stronger. Furthermore, L2/3 acquired a ramp-up response temporal profile, potentially encoding the timing of the associated event, which coincided with a similar change in RSC inputs. Learning also reduced the activity of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons (SOM-INs) in V1 that could potentially gate top-down inputs. Finally, RSC inactivation or SOM-IN activation was sufficient to partially reverse the learning-induced changes in L2/3. Together, these results reveal a learning-dependent dynamic shift in the balance between bottom-up and top-down information streams and uncover a role of SOM-INs in controlling this process.},

abstract = {The flow of visual information is clear at the earliest stages: the retina provides the driving (main signature) activity for the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), which in turn drives the primary visual cortex (V1). These driving pathways can be distinguished anatomically from other modulatory pathways that innervate LGN and V1. The path of visual information after V1, however, is less clear. There are two primary feedforward projections to the secondary visual cortex (V2), one from the lateral/inferior pulvinar and the other from V1. Because both lateral/inferior pulvinar and V2 cannot be driven visually following V1 removal, either or both of these inputs to V2 could be drivers. Retinogeniculate and geniculocortical projections are privileged over modulatory projections by their layer of termination, their bouton size, and the presence of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Vglut2) or parvalbumin (PV). It has been suggested that such properties might also distinguish drivers from modulators in extrastriate cortex. We tested this hypothesis by comparing lateral pulvinar to V2 and V1 to V2 projections with LGN to V1 projections. We found that V1 and lateral pulvinar projections to V2 are similar in that they target the same layers and lack PV. Projections from pulvinar to V2, however, bear a greater similarity to projections from LGN to V1 because of their larger boutons (measured at the same location in V2) and positive staining for Vglut2. These data lend support to the hypothesis that the pulvinar could act as a driver for V2.},

abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex of many mammals are clustered according to their preference to stimulus parameters such as orientation and spatial frequency. Nevertheless, responses to complex visual stimuli are highly heterogeneous between adjacent neurons. To investigate the relation between these observations, we recorded from pairs of neighboring neurons in area 17 of anesthetized cats in response to stimuli of differing complexity: sinusoidal drifting gratings, binary dense noise, and natural movies. Comparisons of the tuning curves revealed similar orientation and direction preferences for neighboring neurons, but large differences in preferred phase, direction selectivity, and tuning width of spatial frequency. No pair was similar across all tuning properties. The neurons' firing rates averaged across multiple stimulus repetitions (the "signal") were also compared. Binned between 10 and 200 ms, the correlation between these signals was close to zero in the median across all pairs for all stimulus classes. Signal correlations agreed poorly with differences in tuning properties, except for receptive field offset and relative modulation (i.e., the strength of phase modulation). Nonetheless, signal correlations for different stimulus classes were well correlated with each other, even for gratings and movies. Conversely, trial-to-trial fluctuations (termed "noise") were poorly correlated between neighboring neurons, suggesting low degrees of common input. In response to gratings and visual noise, signal and noise correlations were well correlated with each other, but less so for responses to movies. These findings have relevance for our understanding of the processing of natural stimuli in a functionally heterogeneous cortical network.},

abstract = {A complete understanding of sensory and motor processing requires characterization of how the nervous system processes time in the range of tens to hundreds of milliseconds (ms). Temporal processing on this scale is required for simple sensory problems, such as interval, duration, and motion discrimination, as well as complex forms of sensory processing, such as speech recognition. Timing is also required for a wide range of motor tasks from eyelid conditioning to playing the piano. Here we review the behavioral, electrophysiological, and theoretical literature on the neural basis of temporal processing. These data suggest that temporal processing is likely to be distributed among different structures, rather than relying on a centralized timing area, as has been suggested in internal clock models. We also discuss whether temporal processing relies on specialized neural mechanisms, which perform temporal computations independent of spatial ones. We suggest that, given the intricate link between temporal and spatial information in most sensory and motor tasks, timing and spatial processing are intrinsic properties of neural function, and specialized timing mechanisms such as delay lines, oscillators, or a spectrum of different time constants are not required. Rather temporal processing may rely on state-dependent changes in network dynamics.},

abstract = {The integrative properties of neurons depend strongly on the number, proportions and distribution of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs they receive. In this study the three-dimensional geometry of dendritic trees and the density of symmetrical and asymmetrical synapses on different cellular compartments of rat hippocampal CA1 area pyramidal cells was measured to calculate the total number and distribution of excitatory and inhibitory inputs on a single cell.A single pyramidal cell has approximately 12,000 microm dendrites and receives around 30,000 excitatory and 1700 inhibitory inputs, of which 40 {\%} are concentrated in the perisomatic region and 20 {\%} on dendrites in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare. The pre- and post-synaptic features suggest that CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites are heterogeneous. Strata radiatum and oriens dendrites are similar and differ from stratum lacunosum-moleculare dendrites. Proximal apical and basal strata radiatum and oriens dendrites are spine-free or sparsely spiny. Distal strata radiatum and oriens dendrites (forming 68.5 {\%} of the pyramidal cells' dendritic tree) are densely spiny; their excitatory inputs terminate exclusively on dendritic spines, while inhibitory inputs target only dendritic shafts. The proportion of inhibitory inputs on distal spiny strata radiatum and oriens dendrites is low ( approximately 3 {\%}). In contrast, proximal dendritic segments receive mostly (70-100 {\%}) inhibitory inputs. Only inhibitory inputs innervate the somata (77-103 per cell) and axon initial segments. Dendrites in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare possess moderate to small amounts of spines. Excitatory synapses on stratum lacunosum-moleculare dendrites are larger than the synapses in other layers, are frequently perforated ( approximately 40 {\%}) and can be located on dendritic shafts. Inhibitory inputs, whose percentage is relatively high ( approximately 14-17 {\%}), also terminate on dendritic spines. Our results indicate that: (i) the highly convergent excitation arriving onto the distal dendrites of pyramidal cells is primarily controlled by proximally located inhibition; (ii) the organization of excitatory and inhibitory inputs in layers receiving Schaffer collateral input (radiatum/oriens) versus perforant path input (lacunosum-moleculare) is significantly different.},

abstract = {Visual stimuli that are frequently seen together become associated in long-term memory, such that the sight of one stimulus readily brings to mind the thought or image of the other. It has been hypothesized that acquisition of such long-term associative memories proceeds via the strengthening of connections between neurons representing the associated stimuli, such that a neuron initially responding only to one stimulus of an associated pair eventually comes to respond to both. Consistent with this hypothesis, studies have demonstrated that individual neurons in the primate inferior temporal cortex tend to exhibit similar responses to pairs of visual stimuli that have become behaviorally associated. In the present study, we investigated the role of these areas in the formation of conditional visual associations by monitoring the responses of individual neurons during the learning of new stimulus pairs. We found that many neurons in both area TE and perirhinal cortex came to elicit more similar neuronal responses to paired stimuli as learning proceeded. Moreover, these neuronal response changes were learning-dependent and proceeded with an average time course that paralleled learning. This experience-dependent plasticity of sensory representations in the cerebral cortex may underlie the learning of associations between objects.},

A closely related function is to signal when a prediction has been violated. The identity of the brain regions that mediate these functions is not known. We set out to determine whether they are implemented at the level of single neurons in the visual system. We gave monkeys prolonged exposure to pairs of images presented in fixed sequence so that each leading image became a strong predictor for the corresponding trailing image. We then monitored the responses of neurons in the inferotemporal cortex to image sequences that obeyed or violated the transitional rules imposed during training. Inferotemporal neurons exhibited a transitional surprise effect, responding much more strongly to unpredicted transitions than to predicted transitions. Thus, neurons even in the visual system make experience-based predictions and react when they fail.},

All this is consistent with column bursting in temporal memory. In this paper you can't tell whether the surprise is along a minicolumn or not. 








Additional experiments showed that unpredicted firing had slightly longer latency than predicted firing. This is consistent with prediction tied to depolarization. Predicted firing was about 5 msecs faster than unpredicted firing.

To understand the dynamics of neocortical intrinsic activity better, we performed two-photon calcium imaging of populations of neurons from the primary visual cortex of awake mice during visual stimulation and spontaneous activity. In both conditions, cortical activity is dominated by coactive groups of neurons, forming ensembles whose activation cannot be explained by the independent firing properties of their contributing neurons, considered in isolation. Moreover, individual neurons flexibly join multiple ensembles, vastly expanding the encoding potential of the circuit. Intriguingly, the same coactive ensembles can repeat spontaneously and in response to visual stimuli, indicating that stimulus-evoked responses arise from activating these intrinsic building blocks. Although the spatial properties of stimulus-driven and spontaneous ensembles are similar, spontaneous ensembles are active at random intervals, whereas visually evoked ensembles are time-locked to stimuli. We conclude that neuronal ensembles, built by the coactivation of flexible groups of neurons, are emergent functional units of cortical activity and propose that visual stimuli recruit intrinsically generated ensembles to represent visual attributes.},

New studies have shown that place cells are part of a broader circuit for dynamic representation of self-location. A key component of this network is the entorhinal grid cells, which, by virtue of their tessellating firing fields, may provide the elements of a path integration-based neural map. Here we review how place cells and grid cells may form the basis for quantitative spatiotemporal representation of places, routes, and associated experiences during behavior and in memory. Because these cell types have some of the most conspicuous behavioral correlates among neurons in nonsensory cortical systems, and because their spatial firing structure reflects computations internally in the system, studies of entorhinal-hippocampal representations may offer considerable insight into general principles of cortical network dynamics.},

abstract = {The modular organization of nervous systems is a widely documented principle of design for both vertebrate and invertebrate brains of which the columnar organization of the neocortex is an example. The classical cytoarchitectural areas of the neocortex are composed of smaller units, local neural circuits repeated iteratively within each area. Modules may vary in cell type and number, in internal and external connectivity, and in mode of neuronal processing between different large entities; within any single large entity they have a basic similarity of internal design and operation. Modules are most commonly grouped into entities by sets of dominating external connections. This unifying factor is most obvious for the heterotypical sensory and motor areas of the neocortex. Columnar defining factors in homotypical areas are generated, in part, within the cortex itself. The set of all modules composing such an entity may be fractionated into different modular subsets by different extrinsic connections. Linkages between them and subsets in other large entities form distributed systems. The neighborhood relations between connected subsets of modules in different entities result in nested distributed systems that serve distributed functions. A cortical area defined in classical cytoarchitectural terms may belong to more than one and sometimes to several distributed systems. Columns in cytoarchitectural areas located at some distance from one another, but with some common properties, may be linked by long-range, intracortical connections.},

abstract = {Neurons in the lateral intraparietal area, frontal eye field, and superior colliculus exhibit a pattern of activity known as remapping. When a salient visual stimulus is presented shortly before a saccade, the representation of that stimulus is updated, or remapped, at the time of the eye movement. This updating is presumably based on a corollary discharge of the eye movement command. To investigate whether visual areas also exhibit remapping, we recorded from single neurons in extrastriate and striate cortex while monkeys performed a saccade task. Around the time of the saccade, a visual stimulus was flashed either at the location occupied by the neuron's receptive field (RF) before the saccade (old RF) or at the location occupied by it after the saccade (new RF). More than half (52{\%}) of V3A neurons responded to a stimulus flashed in the new RF even though the stimulus had already disappeared before the saccade. These neurons responded to a trace of the flashed stimulus brought into the RF by the saccade. In 16{\%} of V3A neurons, remapped activity began even before saccade onset. Remapping also was observed at earlier stages of the visual hierarchy, including in areas V3 and V2. At these earlier stages, the proportion of neurons that exhibited remapping decreased, and the latency of remapped activity increased relative to saccade onset. Remapping was very rare in striate cortex. These results indicate that extrastriate visual areas are involved in the process of remapping.},

Principles that underlie communication between columns remain however unknown. Here we unravel these by reconstructing in vivo-labeled neurons from all excitatory cell types in the vibrissal part of rat primary somatosensory cortex (vS1). Integrating the morphologies into an exact 3D model of vS1 revealed that the majority of intracortical (IC) axons project far beyond the borders of the principal column. We defined the corresponding innervation volume as the IC-unit. Deconstructing this structural cortical unit into its cell type-specific components, we found asymmetric projections that innervate columns of either the same whisker row or arc, and which subdivide vS1 into 2 orthogonal [supra-]granular and infragranular strata. We show that such organization could be most effective for encoding multi whisker inputs. Communication between columns is thus organized by multiple highly specific horizontal projection patterns, rendering IC-units as the primary structural entities for processing complex sensory stimuli.},

abstract = {Basal dendrites receive the majority of synapses that contact neocortical pyramidal neurons, yet our knowledge of synaptic processing in these dendrites has been hampered by their inaccessibility for electrical recordings. A new approach to patch-clamp recordings enabled us to characterize the integrative properties of these cells. Despite the short physical length of rat basal dendrites, synaptic inputs were electrotonically remote from the soma (>30-fold excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) attenuation) and back-propagating action potentials were significantly attenuated. Unitary EPSPs were location dependent, reaching large amplitudes distally (>8 mV), yet their somatic contribution was relatively location independent. Basal dendrites support sodium and NMDA spikes, but not calcium spikes, for 75{\%} of their length. This suggests that basal dendrites, despite their proximity to the site of action potential initiation, do not form a single basal-somatic region but rather should be considered as a separate integrative compartment favoring two integration modes: subthreshold, location-independent summation versus local amplification of incoming spatiotemporally clustered information.},

To observe both processes simultaneously, we performed long-term imaging of non-spiny dendritic arbors expressing a fluorescent postsynaptic marker protein as they arborized within the optic tectum of live zebrafish larvae. Our results indicate that almost all synapses form initially on newly extended dendritic filopodia. A fraction of these nascent synapses are maintained, which in turn stabilizes the subset of filopodia on which they form. Stabilized filopodia mature into dendritic branches, and successive iterations of this process result in growth and branching of the arbor. These findings support a 'synaptotropic model' in which synapse formation can direct dendrite arborization.},

We have now studied the response properties of neurons in primary visual cortex of awake mice that were allowed to run on a freely rotating spherical treadmill with their heads fixed. Most neurons showed more than a doubling of visually evoked firing rate as the animal transitioned from standing still to running, without changes in spontaneous firing or stimulus selectivity. Tuning properties in the awake animal were similar to those measured previously in anesthetized animals. Response magnitude in the lateral geniculate nucleus did not increase with locomotion, demonstrating that the striking change in responsiveness did not result from peripheral effects at the eye. Interestingly, some narrow-spiking cells were spontaneously active during running but suppressed by visual stimuli.

abstract = {It is currently not known how distributed neuronal responses in early visual areas carry stimulus-related information. We made multielectrode recordings from cat primary visual cortex and applied methods from machine learning in order to analyze the temporal evolution of stimulus-related information in the spiking activity of large ensembles of around 100 neurons. We used sequences of up to three different visual stimuli (letters of the alphabet) presented for 100 ms and with intervals of 100 ms or larger. Most of the information about visual stimuli extractable by sophisticated methods of machine learning, i.e., support vector machines with nonlinear kernel functions, was also extractable by simple linear classification such as can be achieved by individual neurons. New stimuli did not erase information about previous stimuli. The responses to the most recent stimulus contained about equal amounts of information about both this and the preceding stimulus. This information was encoded both in the discharge rates (response amplitudes) of the ensemble of neurons and, when using short time constants for integration (e.g., 20 ms), in the precise timing of individual spikes (<or= approximately 20 ms), and persisted for several 100 ms beyond the offset of stimuli. The results indicate that the network from which we recorded is endowed with fading memory and is capable of performing online computations utilizing information about temporally sequential stimuli. This result challenges models assuming frame-by-frame analyses of sequential inputs.},

abstract = {The receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian primary visual cortex can be characterized as being spatially localized, oriented and bandpass (selective to structure at different spatial scales), comparable to the basis functions of wavelet transforms. One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs.},

This strategy, referred to as 'sparse coding', could possibly confer several advantages. First, it allows for increased storage capacity in associative memories; second, it makes the structure in natural signals explicit; third, it represents complex data in a way that is easier to read out at subsequent levels of processing; and fourth, it saves energy. Recent physiological recordings from sensory neurons have indicated that sparse coding could be a ubiquitous strategy employed in several different modalities across different organisms. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The spatial receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian striate cortex have been reasonably well described physiologically and can be characterized as being localized, oriented, and bandpass, comparable with the basis functions of wavelet transforms. Previously, we have shown that these receptive field properties may be accounted for in terms of a strategy for producing a sparse distribution of output activity in response to natural images. Here, in addition to describing this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the neurobiological implications of sparse coding. Of particular interest is the case when the code is overcomplete - i.e., when the number of code elements is greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space. Because the basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent of each other, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis functions necessary for representing a given input, and so the input-output function will deviate from being purely linear. These deviations from linearity provide a potential explanation for the weak forms of non-linearity observed in the response properties of cortical simple cells, and they further make predictions about the expected interactions among units in response to naturalistic stimuli.},

Despite their pivotal position and acknowledged diversity these neurons are traditionally separated into broad commissural and corticofugal types, and until now no attempt has been made at resolving the basis for their diversity. We therefore probed the electrophysiological and morphological properties of retrogradely labeled M1 corticospinal (CSp), corticothalamic (CTh), and commissural projecting corticostriatal (CStr) and corticocortical (CC) neurons. An unsupervised cluster analysis established at least four phenotypes with additional differences between lumbar and cervical projecting CSp neurons. Distinguishing parameters included the action potential (AP) waveform, firing behavior, the hyperpolarisation-activated sag potential, sublayer position, and soma and dendrite size. CTh neurons differed from CSp neurons in showing spike frequency acceleration and a greater sag potential. CStr neurons had the lowest AP amplitude and maximum rise rate of all neurons. Temperature influenced spike train behavior in corticofugal neurons. At 26°C CTh neurons fired bursts of APs more often than CSp neurons, but at 36°C both groups fired regular APs. Our findings provide reliable phenotypic fingerprints to identify distinct M1 projection neuron classes as a tool to understand their unique contributions to motor function.},

However, it has so far proved difficult to demonstrate their existence in vivo. Moreover, it is not clear whether NMDA spikes are relevant to the output of pyramidal neurons. We found that local NMDA spikes occurred in tuft dendrites of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons both spontaneously and following sensory input, and had a large influence on the number of output action potentials. Using two-photon activation of an intracellular caged NMDA receptor antagonist (tc-MK801), we found that isolated NMDA spikes typically occurred in multiple branches simultaneously and that sensory stimulation substantially increased their probability. Our results demonstrate that NMDA receptors have a vital role in coupling the tuft region of the layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron to the cell body, enhancing the effectiveness of layer 1 input.},

The dendrites of individual cortical neurons overlap with numerous types of local and long-range excitatory axons, but axodendritic overlap is not always a good predictor of actual connection strength. Here we developed an efficient channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-assisted method to map the spatial distribution of synaptic inputs, defined by presynaptic ChR2 expression, within the dendritic arborizations of recorded neurons. We expressed ChR2 in two thalamic nuclei, the whisker motor cortex and local excitatory neurons and mapped their synapses with pyramidal neurons in layers 3, 5A and 5B (L3, L5A and L5B) in the mouse barrel cortex. Within the dendritic arborizations of L3 cells, individual inputs impinged onto distinct single domains. These domains were arrayed in an orderly, monotonic pattern along the apical axis: axons from more central origins targeted progressively higher regions of the apical dendrites. In L5 arborizations, different inputs targeted separate basal and apical domains. Input to L3 and L5 dendrites in L1 was related to whisker movement and position, suggesting that these signals have a role in controlling the gain of their target neurons. Our experiments reveal high specificity in the subcellular organization of excitatory circuits.},

@article{Piuri2001,
abstract = {Wide attention was recently given to the problem of fault-tolerance in neural networks; while most authors dealt with aspects related to specific VLSI implementations, attention was also given to the intrinsic capacity of survival to faults characterizing the neural modes. The present paper tackles this second theme, considering in particular multilayered feed forward nets. One of the main goals is to identify the real influence of faults on the neural computation in order to show that neural paradigms cannot be considered intrinsically fault tolerant (i.e., able to survive to faults, even several of the most common and simple ones). A high abstraction level (corresponding to the neural graphs) is taken as the basis of the study and a corresponding error model is introduced. The effects of such errors induced by faults are analytically derived to verify the probability of intrinsic masking in the final neural outputs. Then, conditions allowing for complete compensation of the errors induced by faults through weight adjustment are evaluated to test the masking abilities of the network. The designer of a neural architecture should perform such a mathematical analysis to check the actual fault-tolerance features of his or her system. Unfortunately, this involves a very high computational overhead. As a cost-effective alternative for the designer, the use of a behavioral simulation is proposed for a quantitative evaluation of the error effect on the neural computation. Repeated learning (i.e., a new application of the learning procedure on the faulty network) is then experimented to induce error masking. Experimental results prove that even single errors affect the computation in a relevant way and that weight redistribution is not able to induce complete masking after a fault occurred, i.e., the network cannot be considered per se intrinsically fault tolerant and it is not possible to rely on learning only in order to achieve complete masking abilities. Mapping criteria of physical faults onto the abstract errors are finally examined to show the usability of the proposed analysis in evaluating the actual robustness of a neural networks' implementation and in identifying the critical areas where architectural redundancy should be introduced to achieve fault tolerance.},

abstract = {Anatomical and physiological experiments have outlined a blueprint for the feedforward flow of activity in cortical circuits: signals are thought to propagate primarily from the middle cortical layer (layer 4, L4) up to L2/3 and down to the major cortical output layer (L5). Pharmacological manipulations, however, have contested this model and have suggested that L4 may not be critical for sensory responses of neurons in either superficial or deep layers. To address these conflicting models, we reversibly manipulated L4 activity in awake, behaving mice using cell type-specific optogenetics. In contrast with both prevailing models, we found that activity in L4 directly suppressed L5, in part by activating deep, fast-spiking inhibitory neurons. Our data suggest that the net effect of L4 activity is to sharpen the spatial representations of L5 neurons. Thus, we establish a previously unknown translaminar inhibitory circuit in the sensory cortex that acts to enhance the feature selectivity of cortical output.},
annote = {
Background: The classical view of the cortical circuit suggest a feedforward excitatory pathway Input-{\&}gt;L4-{\&}gt;L2/3-{\&}gt;L5-{\&}gt;Output. A recent study shows that L4 is not required for sensory responses in L5, and thus suggest that thalamus activates two separate, independent {\&}quot;strata{\&}quot; of cortex in parallel [1]. The motivation of this study is to assess these competing models using cell type specific manipulation in awake, behaving animals. The inhibitory pathway is more of a surprise than expected.

Experiment Approach:
1. In awake, running animals, directly activate or suppress L4 cell activity using optogenetics,record neural response from neurons across cortical depth using a laminar probe.
2. In vitro, paired patch clamp recording, to prove the existence of a direct inhibitory circuit

Conclusion:
1. Optogenetic suppression of L4 deactivates L2/3 but L5, Activation of L4 has the opposite effect (activates L2/3 and suppress L5). 
2. Suppression of L4 leads to broader spatial tuning of L5.
3. Activation of L4 neurons directly activate fast-spiking inhibitory neurons in L5. This circuit persists in the absence of L2/3.

The experiments here is solid. I am not sure about their interpretation of the function of this circuit though ({\&}quot;The functional consequence of this circuit is to enhance the feature selectivity of cortical output{\&}quot;). Their interpretation is based on the fact that suppression of L4 caused broader tuning curve. It is hard for me to believe this is the only function of this circuit. The authors implies that the connection between L4 to inhibitory neurons in L5 is selective. I think further experiment on how this selectivity is will help us understand the function of this circuit.},

Using a detailed compartmental model of a hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell, we recorded responses to complex stimuli consisting of dozens of high-frequency activated synapses distributed throughout the apical dendrites. We found the cell's firing rate could be predicted by a simple formula that maps the physical components of the cell onto those of an abstract two-layer "neural network." In the first layer, synaptic inputs drive independent sigmoidal subunits corresponding to the cell's several dozen long, thin terminal dendrites. The subunit outputs are then summed within the main trunk and cell body prior to final thresholding.

Previous studies have most often reported global linear or sublinear summation. An alternative view, supported by biophysical modeling studies, holds that thin dendrites provide a layer of independent computational 'subunits' that sigmoidally modulate their inputs prior to global summation. To distinguish these possibilities, we combined confocal imaging and dual-site focal synaptic stimulation of identified thin dendrites in rat neocortical pyramidal neurons. We found that nearby inputs on the same branch summed sigmoidally, whereas widely separated inputs or inputs to different branches summed linearly. This strong spatial compartmentalization effect is incompatible with a global summation rule and provides the first experimental support for a two-layer 'neural network' model of pyramidal neuron thin-branch integration.

abstract = {Bursts of action potentials are important information-bearing signals in the brain, although the neuronal specializations underlying burst generation and detection are only partially understood. In apical dendrites of neocortical pyramidal neurons, calcium spikes are known to contribute to burst generation, but a comparable understanding of basal dendritic mechanisms is lacking. Here we show that NMDA spikes in basal dendrites mediate both detection and generation of bursts through a postsynaptic mechanism. High-frequency inputs to basal dendrites markedly facilitated NMDA spike initiation compared with low-frequency activation or single inputs. Unlike conventional temporal summation effects based on voltage, however, NMDA spike facilitation depended mainly on residual glutamate bound to NMDA receptors from previous activations. Once triggered by an input burst, we found that NMDA spikes in turn reliably trigger output bursts under in vivo-like stimulus conditions. Through their unique biophysical properties, NMDA spikes are thus ideally suited to promote the propagation of bursts through the cortical network.},
annote = {This paper makes the argument that dendrites preferentially respond (generate NMDA spikes) to inputs where the synapses receive small bursts of APs. And that the post-synaptic cell is more likely to have a small burst of APs when the dendrites receive burst inputs. HTM theory needs a method to distinguish whether input to a region comes from a region that made correct predictions or whether the input to a region comes from a region that didn’t make correct predictions. HTM theory needs this to know if the input should undergo temporal pooling or not. Small bursts of APs are ideally suited to make this distinction, a burst indicating the cell had predicted its input. For example Layer 5 cells that project through the Thalamus to the next higher region sometimes burst and sometimes they don’t. The burst could tell the next region whether of not the Layer 5 cell had predicted its activity (via an NMDA dendritic spike).








The paper also discusses how input to the distal end of a dendrite will affect the input to the proximal end. This fits nicely with the temporal memory concepts of HTM.},

abstract = {Learning from instructions or demonstrations is a fundamental property of our brain necessary to acquire new knowledge and develop novel skills or behavioral patterns. This type of learning is thought to be involved in most of our daily routines. Although the concept of instruction-based learning has been studied for several decades, the exact neural mechanisms implementing this process remain unrevealed. One of the central questions in this regard is, How do neurons learn to reproduce template signals (instructions) encoded in precisely timed sequences of spikes? Here we present a model of supervised learning for biologically plausible neurons that addresses this question. In a set of experiments, we demonstrate that our approach enables us to train spiking neurons to reproduce arbitrary template spike patterns in response to given synaptic stimuli even in the presence of various sources of noise. We show that the learning rule can also be used for decision-making tasks. Neurons can be trained to classify categories of input signals based on only a temporal configuration of spikes. The decision is communicated by emitting precisely timed spike trains associated with given input categories. Trained neurons can perform the classification task correctly even if stimuli and corresponding decision times are temporally separated and the relevant information is consequently highly overlapped by the ongoing neural activity. Finally, we demonstrate that neurons can be trained to reproduce sequences of spikes with a controllable time shift with respect to target templates. A reproduced signal can follow or even precede the targets. This surprising result points out that spiking neurons can potentially be applied to forecast the behavior (firing times) of other reference neurons or networks.},

Despite this, there is little quantitative data on spatial distributions of specific types of synaptic input. Here we use array tomography (AT), a high-resolution optical microscopy method, to examine thalamocortical (TC) input onto layer 5 pyramidal neurons. We first verified the ability of AT to identify synapses using parallel electron microscopic analysis of TC synapses in layer 4. We then use large-scale array tomography (LSAT) to measure TC synapse distribution on L5 pyramidal neurons in a 1.00 × 0.83 × 0.21 mm(3) volume of mouse somatosensory cortex. We found that TC synapses primarily target basal dendrites in layer 5, but also make a considerable input to proximal apical dendrites in L4, consistent with previous work. Our analysis further suggests that TC inputs are biased toward certain branches and, within branches, synapses show significant clustering with an excess of TC synapse nearest neighbors within 5-15 $\mu$m compared to a random distribution. Thus, we show that AT is a sensitive and quantitative method to map specific types of synaptic input on the dendrites of entire neurons. We anticipate that this technique will be of wide utility for mapping functionally-relevant anatomical connectivity in neural circuits.},

Why is there such massive recurrent excitation in the neocortex and what is its role in cortical computation ? Recent neurophysiological experiments have shown that the plasticity of recurrent neocortical synapses is governed by a temporally asymmetric Hebbian learning rule. We describe how such a rule may allow the cortex to modify recurrent synapses for prediction of input sequences. The goal is to predict the next cortical input from the recent past based on previous experience of similar input sequences. We show that a temporal difference learning rule for prediction used in conjunction with dendritic back-propagating action potentials reproduces the temporally asymmetric Hebbian plasticity observed physiologically. Biophysical simulations demonstrate that a network of cortical neurons can learn t...},

abstract = {The functional specialization and hierarchical organization of multiple areas in rhesus monkey auditory cortex were examined with various types of complex sounds. Neurons in the lateral belt areas of the superior temporal gyrus were tuned to the best center frequency and bandwidth of band-passed noise bursts. They were also selective for the rate and direction of linear frequency modulated sweeps. Many neurons showed a preference for a limited number of species-specific vocalizations ("monkey calls"). These response selectivities can be explained by nonlinear spectral and temporal integration mechanisms. In a separate series of experiments, monkey calls were presented at different spatial locations, and the tuning of lateral belt neurons to monkey calls and spatial location was determined. Of the three belt areas the anterolateral area shows the highest degree of specificity for monkey calls, whereas neurons in the caudolateral area display the greatest spatial selectivity. We conclude that the cortical auditory system of primates is divided into at least two processing streams, a spatial stream that originates in the caudal part of the superior temporal gyrus and projects to the parietal cortex, and a pattern or object stream originating in the more anterior portions of the lateral belt. A similar division of labor can be seen in human auditory cortex by using functional neuroimaging.},

abstract = {Animals must distinguish behaviorally relevant patterns of sensory stimulation from those that are attributable to their own movements. In principle, this distinction could be made based on internal signals related to motor commands, known as corollary discharge (CD), sensory feedback, or some combination of both. Here we use an advantageous model system--the electrosensory lobe (ELL) of weakly electric mormyrid fish--to directly examine how CD and proprioceptive feedback signals are transformed into negative images of the predictable electrosensory consequences of the fish's motor commands and/or movements. In vivo recordings from ELL neurons and theoretical modeling suggest that negative images are formed via anti-Hebbian plasticity acting on random, nonlinear mixtures of CD and proprioception. In support of this, we find that CD and proprioception are randomly mixed in spinal mossy fibers and that properties of granule cells are consistent with a nonlinear recoding of these signals. The mechanistic account provided here may be relevant to understanding how internal models of movement consequences are implemented in other systems in which similar components (e.g., mixed sensory and motor signals and synaptic plasticity) are found.},

@article{Rinkus2014,
abstract = {The visual cortex’s hierarchical, multi-level organization is captured in many biologically inspired computational vision models, the general idea being that progressively larger scale (spatially/temporally) and more complex visual features are represented in progressively higher areas. However, most earlier models use localist representations (codes) in each representational field (which we equate with the cortical macrocolumn, “mac”), at each level. In localism, each represented feature/concept/event (hereinafter “item”) is coded by a single unit. The model we describe, Sparsey, is hierarchical as well but crucially, it uses sparse distributed coding (SDC) in every mac in all levels. In SDC, each represented item is coded by a small subset of the mac’s units. The SDCs of different items can overlap and the size of overlap between items can be used to represent their similarity. The difference between localism and SDC is crucial because SDC allows the two essential operations of associative memory, storing a new item and retrieving the best-matching stored item, to be done in fixed time for the life of the model. Since the model’s core algorithm, which does both storage and retrieval (inference), makes a single pass over all macs on each time step, the overall model’s storage/retrieval operation is also fixed-time, a criterion we consider essential for scalability to the huge (“Big Data”) problems. A 2010 paper described a non-hierarchical version of this model in the context of purely spatial pattern processing. Here, we elaborate a fully hierarchical model (arbitrary numbers of levels and macs per level), describing novel model principles like progressive critical periods, dynamic modulation of principal cells’ activation functions based on a mac-level familiarity measure, representation of multiple simultaneously active hypotheses, a novel method of time warp invariant recognition, and we report results showing learning/recognition of spatiotemporal patterns.},

Whole-cell recordings from barrel cortex neurons revealed membrane potential correlates of sensory perception. Sensory responses depended strongly on prestimulus cortical state, but both slow-wave and desynchronized cortical states were compatible with task performance. Whisker deflection evoked an early (<50 ms) reliable sensory response that was encoded through cell-specific reversal potentials. A secondary late (50-400 ms) depolarization was enhanced on hit trials compared to misses. Optogenetic inactivation revealed a causal role for late excitation.

Its level of activity, both at rest and during auditory or tactile tasks, is higher in blind subjects than in normal controls, suggesting that it can subserve nonvisual functions; however, a direct effect of non-visual tasks on activation has not been demonstrated. To determine whether the visual cortex receives input from the somatosensory system we used positron emission tomography (PET) to measure activation during tactile discrimination tasks in normal subjects and in Braille readers blinded in early life. Blind subjects showed activation of primary and secondary visual cortical areas during tactile tasks, whereas normal controls showed deactivation. A simple tactile stimulus that did not require discrimination produced no activation of visual areas in either group. Thus in blind subjects, cortical areas normally reserved for vision may be activated by other sensory modalities.},

abstract = {Successful navigation through the world requires accurate estimation of one's own speed. To derive this estimate, animals integrate visual speed gauged from optic flow and run speed gauged from proprioceptive and locomotor systems. The primary visual cortex (V1) carries signals related to visual speed, and its responses are also affected by run speed. To study how V1 combines these signals during navigation, we recorded from mice that traversed a virtual environment. Nearly half of the V1 neurons were reliably driven by combinations of visual speed and run speed. These neurons performed a weighted sum of the two speeds. The weights were diverse across neurons, and typically positive. As a population, V1 neurons predicted a linear combination of visual and run speeds better than either visual or run speeds alone. These data indicate that V1 in the mouse participates in a multimodal processing system that integrates visual motion and locomotion during navigation.},

abstract = {Basal dendrites are a major target for synaptic inputs innervating cortical pyramidal neurons. At present little is known about signal processing in these fine dendrites. Here we show that coactivation of clustered neighbouring basal inputs initiated local dendritic spikes, which resulted in a 5.9 +/- 1.5 mV (peak) and 64.4 +/- 19.8 ms (half-width) cable-filtered voltage change at the soma that amplified the somatic voltage response by 226 +/- 46{\%}. These spikes were accompanied by large calcium transients restricted to the activated dendritic segment. In contrast to conventional sodium or calcium spikes, these spikes were mediated mostly by NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor channels, which contributed at least 80{\%} of the total charge. The ionic mechanism of these NMDA spikes may allow 'dynamic spike-initiation zones', set by the spatial distribution of glutamate pre-bound to NMDA receptors, which in turn would depend on recent and ongoing activity in the cortical network. In addition, NMDA spikes may serve as a powerful mechanism for modification of the cortical network by inducing long-term strengthening of co-activated neighbouring inputs.},

abstract = {Apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal cells in a slice preparation of rat sensorimotor cortex were depolarized focally by long-lasting glutamate iontophoresis while recording intracellularly from their soma. In most cells the firing pattern evoked by the smallest dendritic depolarization that evoked spikes consisted of repetitive bursts of action potentials. During larger dendritic depolarizations initial burst firing was followed by regular spiking. As dendritic depolarization was increased further the duration (but not the firing rate) of the regular spiking increased, and the duration of burst firing decreased. Depolarization of the soma in most of the same cells evoked only regular spiking. When the dendrite was depolarized to a critical level below spike threshold, intrasomatic current pulses or excitatory postsynaptic potentials also triggered bursts instead of single spikes. The bursts were driven by a delayed depolarization (DD) that was triggered in an all-or-none manner along with the first Na+ spike of the burst. Somatic voltage-clamp experiments indicated that the action current underlying the DD was generated in the dendrite and was Ca2+ dependent. Thus the burst firing was caused by a Na+ spike-linked dendritic Ca2+ spike, a mechanism that was available only when the dendrite was adequately depolarized. Larger dendritic depolarization that evoked late, constant-frequency regular spiking also evoked a long-lasting, Ca2+-dependent action potential (a "plateau"). The duration of the plateau but not its amplitude was increased by stronger dendritic depolarization. Burst-generating dendritic Ca2+ spikes could not be elicited during this plateau. Thus plateau initiation was responsible for the termination of burst firing and the generation of the constant-frequency regular spiking. We conclude that somatic and dendritic depolarization can elicit quite different firing patterns in the same pyramidal neuron. The burst and regular spiking observed during dendritic depolarization are caused by two types of Ca2+-dependent dendritic action potentials. We discuss some functional implications of these observations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: What roles do the different cortical layers play in visual processing? We recorded simultaneously from all layers of the primary visual cortex while monkeys performed a figure-ground segregation task. This task can be divided into different subprocesses that are thought to engage feedforward, horizontal, and feedback processes at different time points. These different connection types have different patterns of laminar terminations in V1 and can therefore be distinguished with laminar recordings.

RESULTS: We found that the visual response started 40 ms after stimulus presentation in layers 4 and 6, which are targets of feedforward connections from the lateral geniculate nucleus and distribute activity to the other layers. Boundary detection started shortly after the visual response. In this phase, boundaries of the figure induced synaptic currents and stronger neuronal responses in upper layer 4 and the superficial layers {\~{}}70 ms after stimulus onset, consistent with the hypothesis that they are detected by horizontal connections. In the next phase, {\~{}}30 ms later, synaptic inputs arrived in layers 1, 2, and 5 that receive feedback from higher visual areas, which caused the filling in of the representation of the entire figure with enhanced neuronal activity.

CONCLUSIONS: The present results reveal unique contributions of the different cortical layers to the formation of a visual percept. This new blueprint of laminar processing may generalize to other tasks and to other areas of the cerebral cortex, where the layers are likely to have roles similar to those in area V1.},

Primary visual cortex (V1) is characterized by orientation modules--groups of cells that share a preferred stimulus orientation--which are organized into a highly ordered orientation map. Here we show that in ferrets in which retinal projections are routed into the auditory pathway, visually responsive neurons in 'rewired' primary auditory cortex are also organized into orientation modules. The orientation tuning of neurons within these modules is comparable to the tuning of cells in V1 but the orientation map is less orderly. Horizontal connections in rewired cortex are more patchy and periodic than connections in normal auditory cortex, but less so than connections in V1. These data show that afferent activity has a profound influence on diverse components of cortical circuitry, including thalamocortical and local intracortical connections, which are involved in the generation of orientation tuning, and long-range horizontal connections, which are important in creating an orientation map.},

Based on foundations established earlier in their book Exploring the Thalamus and Its Role in Cortical Function, the authors consider the implications of these ground rules for thalamic inputs, thalamocortical connections, and cortical outputs. The authors argue that functional and structural analyses of pathways connecting thalamus and cortex point beyond these to lower centers and through them to the body and the world. Each cortical area depends on the messages linking it to body and world. These messages relate to the way we act and think; each cortical area receives thalamic inputs and has outputs to motor centers. Sherman and Guillery go on to discuss such topics as the role of branching axons that carry motor instructions as well as copies of these motor instructions for relay to cortex under the control of the thalamic gate. This gate allows the thalamus to control the passage of information on the basis of which cortex relates to the rest of the nervous system.},

Our result showed that most deep layer pyramidal neurons in the PFC were regular spiking cells. They could fire repetitive bursts, however, when activated by glutamate focally applied to the apical dendrite. Application of NMDA to the same dendritic spot also induced bursting, whereas application of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) evoked single spikes only. Coapplication of AMPA with NMDA evoked more single spikes and decreased NMDA-induced bursting. Experiments with NMDA and AMPA antagonists further showed that dendritic glutamate (dGlu)-induced bursting required NMDA receptor activation and was enhanced when AMPA receptors were blocked. At subanesthetic concentrations, PCP decreased dGlu-induced bursting and altered the temporal characteristics of the bursts by decreasing spikes per burst and increasing interspike intervals within bursts. The latter two changes were not observed when AMPA receptors were blocked, suggesting that they are secondary to the increased AMPA receptor contribution to glutamate responses evoked in the presence of PCP. These results suggest that NMDA receptors are essential for PFC pyramidal cells to fire in bursts in response to dGlu input and that PCP suppresses dGlu-induced bursting. Since bursting is necessary for pyramidal cells to activate GABA interneurons, the suppression effect of PCP may further lead to a weakening of the connections from pyramidal cells and GABA interneurons, thereby contributing to PCP's psychotomimetic effects.},

abstract = {Neuronal dendrites are electrically excitable: they can generate regenerative events such as dendritic spikes in response to sufficiently strong synaptic input. Although such events have been observed in many neuronal types, it is not well understood how active dendrites contribute to the tuning of neuronal output in vivo. Here we show that dendritic spikes increase the selectivity of neuronal responses to the orientation of a visual stimulus (orientation tuning). We performed direct patch-clamp recordings from the dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the primary visual cortex of lightly anaesthetized and awake mice, during sensory processing. Visual stimulation triggered regenerative local dendritic spikes that were distinct from back-propagating action potentials. These events were orientation tuned and were suppressed by either hyperpolarization of membrane potential or intracellular blockade of NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors. Both of these manipulations also decreased the selectivity of subthreshold orientation tuning measured at the soma, thus linking dendritic regenerative events to somatic orientation tuning. Together, our results suggest that dendritic spikes that are triggered by visual input contribute to a fundamental cortical computation: enhancing orientation selectivity in the visual cortex. Thus, dendritic excitability is an essential component of behaviourally relevant computations in neurons.},

Very good paper confirming many of our theories on dendritic segments. They show that Layer 2/3 dendritic segments are locally tuned to specific patterns, and that dendritic spikes can affect basic cortical computation (in this case increasing orientation selectivity).  They hint that this is the first time this connection has been experimentally proven. They showed a lot of this through in vivo recordings, which I found amazing.

Here we consider circuits for solving this problem in the primate brain. Such circuits convey a copy of each motor command, known as a corollary discharge (CD), to brain regions that use sensory input. In the visual system, CD signals may help to produce a stable visual percept from the jumpy images resulting from our rapid eye movements. A candidate pathway for providing CD for vision ascends from the superior colliculus to the frontal cortex in the primate brain. This circuit conveys warning signals about impending eye movements that are used for planning subsequent movements and analyzing the visual world. Identifying this circuit has provided a model for studying CD in other primate sensory systems and may lead to a better understanding of motor and mental disorders.},

abstract = {Each of our movements activates our own sensory receptors, and therefore keeping track of self-movement is a necessary part of analysing sensory input. One way in which the brain keeps track of self-movement is by monitoring an internal copy, or corollary discharge, of motor commands. This concept could explain why we perceive a stable visual world despite our frequent quick, or saccadic, eye movements: corollary discharge about each saccade would permit the visual system to ignore saccade-induced visual changes. The critical missing link has been the connection between corollary discharge and visual processing. Here we show that such a link is formed by a corollary discharge from the thalamus that targets the frontal cortex. In the thalamus, neurons in the mediodorsal nucleus relay a corollary discharge of saccades from the midbrain superior colliculus to the cortical frontal eye field. In the frontal eye field, neurons use corollary discharge to shift their visual receptive fields spatially before saccades. We tested the hypothesis that these two components-a pathway for corollary discharge and neurons with shifting receptive fields-form a circuit in which the corollary discharge drives the shift. First we showed that the known spatial and temporal properties of the corollary discharge predict the dynamic changes in spatial visual processing of cortical neurons when saccades are made. Then we moved from this correlation to causation by isolating single cortical neurons and showing that their spatial visual processing is impaired when corollary discharge from the thalamus is interrupted. Thus the visual processing of frontal neurons is spatiotemporally matched with, and functionally dependent on, corollary discharge input from the thalamus. These experiments establish the first link between corollary discharge and visual processing, delineate a brain circuit that is well suited for mediating visual stability, and provide a framework for studying corollary discharge in other sensory systems.},

In particular, the existence of dendritic domains with distinct synaptic inputs, excitability, modulation and plasticity appears to be a common feature that allows synapses throughout the dendritic tree to contribute to action-potential generation.

Recently, experiments using simultaneous patch-pipette recordings from different locations on the same neuron have been used to address this issue directly. These studies show that the site of action potential initiation is in the axon, even when synaptic activation is powerful enough to elicit dendritic electrogenesis. Furthermore, these and other studies also show that following initiation, action potentials actively backpropagate into the dendrites of many neuronal types, providing a retrograde signal of neuronal output to the dendritic tree.},

abstract = {Particular levels of partial fault tolerance (PFT) in feedforward artificial neural networks of a given size can be obtained by redundancy (replicating a smaller normally trained network), by design (training specifically to increase PFT), and by a combination of the two (replicating a smaller PFT-trained network). This letter investigates the method of achieving the highest PFT per network size (total number of units and connections) for classification problems. It concludes that for non-toy problems, there exists a normally trained network of optimal size that produces the smallest fully fault-tolerant network when replicated. In addition, it shows that for particular network sizes, the best level of PFT is achieved by training a network of that size for fault tolerance. The results and discussion demonstrate how the outcome depends on the levels of saturation of the network nodes when classifying data points. With simple training tasks, where the complexity of the problem and the size of the network are well within the ability of the training method, the hidden-layer nodes operate close to their saturation points, and classification is clean. Under such circumstances, replicating the smallest normally trained correct network yields the highest PFT for any given network size. For hard training tasks (difficult classification problems or network sizes close to the minimum), normal training obtains networks that do not operate close to their saturation points, and outputs are not as close to their targets. In this case, training a larger network for fault tolerance yields better PFT than replicating a smaller, normally trained network. However, since fault-tolerant training on its own produces networks that operate closer to their linear areas than normal training, replicating normally trained networks ultimately leads to better PFT than replicating fault-tolerant networks of the same initial size.},

Summary of key facts



Three Major classes of pyramidal cellsThere are 3 major classes of pyramidal cells in L6 (see Fig. 1 of Thomson paper for a summary). Thomson suggested these are parallel processing streams (page 8), so we shouldn't assume L6 is accomplishing just one single function.  
(1) Corticothalamic (CT) cells, or tall pyramidal cells in Briggs review; CT neurons have well-developed dendritic tufts in L4/5. They also have vertically oriented axons that ascend to L4/5. 
(2) Corticocortical (CC) cells or short pyramidal cells in Briggs review; CC cells come in a range of different shapes. They usually have axons that extend for long distances horizontally and dendritic trees.
(3) Claustrum projecting cells, with a long slender apical dendrite and long horizontally oriented axons confined to the deep layers. 




One recent study (Velez-Fort2014, attached here), further showed that the CC and CT neurons responded differently to visual stimuli. CT neurons mainly fired in response to gratings moving in one direction (orientation-tuning), while CC neurons respond to grating moving in several directions).





Inputs to Layer 6


Local connections: CC cells and claustrum projecting cells innervate all 3 classes of pyramidal cells, but not interneurons. CT cells rarely innervate other pyramidal cells, but frequently innervate inhibitory interneurons.





From other cortical layers (Fig. 2): 
Majority of excitatory input to L6 comes from deep layers (L5/6). Their inputs from L5 appear to be spatially diffuse and involves long, cross-columnar axons. L6 neurons also receive weak connections from L2/3 and L4. There is an interesting discussion that compares L6 with L4 on page 6.





From the thalamus

Upper L6 cells receive direct thalamo-cortical input and exhibits simple cell properties.
Lower L6 CT cells, and all CC cells are more likely to receive less direct input (Page8).





Intracortical Outputs of Layer 6

- L6 CC neurons provide strong excitatory inputs to L5 pyramidal neurons.
- L4 pyramidal cells (not spiny stellate cells) receive weak inputs from L6. The role of these connections are controversial (see discussion on Page 7). One possibility is L6 modulates some of the later components of L4 responses. 





Corticalthalamic outputs

Figure 4 of the Thomson paper provides a nice summary of these pathway. In the primary sensory thalamus, the {\&}quot;feedback{\&}quot; synapses from L6 are smaller, and more distal than the {\&}quot;feedforward{\&}quot; ones. It is likely that they are playing a modulatory role. In the secondary thalamus, however, the larger, proximal synapses are provided by L5/6 cells from a lower region, and the {\&}quot;feedback{\&}quot; synapses from L6 of a higher region plays a modulatory role.},

Spine lifetimes vary greatly: stable spines, about 50{\%} of the population, persist for at least a month, whereas the remainder are present for a few days or less. Serial-section electron microscopy of imaged dendritic segments revealed retrospectively that spine sprouting and retraction are associated with synapse formation and elimination. Experience-dependent plasticity of cortical receptive fields was accompanied by increased synapse turnover. Our measurements suggest that sensory experience drives the formation and elimination of synapses and that these changes might underlie adaptive remodelling of neural circuits.},

abstract = {Neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) of cats show strong stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA). In probabilistic settings, in which one stimulus is common and another is rare, responses to common sounds adapt more strongly than responses to rare sounds. This SSA could be a correlate of auditory sensory memory at the level of single A1 neurons. Here we studied adaptation in A1 neurons, using three different probabilistic designs. We showed that SSA has several time scales concurrently, spanning many orders of magnitude, from hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds. Similar time scales are known for the auditory memory span of humans, as measured both psychophysically and using evoked potentials. A simple model, with linear dependence on both short-term and long-term stimulus history, provided a good fit to A1 responses. Auditory thalamus neurons did not show SSA, and their responses were poorly fitted by the same model. In addition, SSA increased the proportion of failures in the responses of A1 neurons to the adapting stimulus. Finally, SSA caused a bias in the neuronal responses to unbiased stimuli, enhancing the responses to eccentric stimuli. Therefore, we propose that a major function of SSA in A1 neurons is to encode auditory sensory memory on multiple time scales. This SSA might play a role in stream segregation and in binding of auditory objects over many time scales, a property that is crucial for processing of natural auditory scenes in cats and of speech and music in humans.},

Nice (important?) finding is that the surprise responses seem to be organized along columns. Consistent with surprise and bursting columns in our temporal memory.  This last part was the most interesting to me but it is just a side note in this paper. 
Quote: {\&}quot;Together, these data indicate that the tendency of an A1 neuron to undergo adaptation is independent of its tonal response prop- erties and that SSA is a neuronal property that seems to be clus- tered in “adaptation columns.”  (see bottom right of page 10442 to top right of 10444).

abstract = {Visual cortex in primates contains a mosaic of several dozen visual areas that collectively occupy a large fraction of cerebral cortex (approximately 50{\%} in the macaque; approximately 25{\%} in humans). These areas are richly interconnected by hundreds of reciprocal corticocortical pathways that underlie an anatomically based hierarchy containing multiple processing streams. In addition, there is a complex pattern of reciprocal connections with the pulvinar, which itself contains about 10 architectonically distinct subdivisions. Information flow through these corticocortical and corticothalamic circuits is regulated very dynamically by top-down as well as bottom-up processes, including directed visual attention. This chapter evaluates current hypotheses and evidence relating to the interaction between thalamocortical and corticocortical circuitry in the dynamic regulation of information flow.},

abstract = {Sensory computations performed in the neocortex involve layer six (L6) cortico-cortical (CC) and cortico-thalamic (CT) signaling pathways. Developing an understanding of the physiological role of these circuits requires dissection of the functional specificity and connectivity of the underlying individual projection neurons. By combining whole-cell recording from identified L6 principal cells in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) with modified rabies virus-based input mapping, we have determined the sensory response properties and upstream monosynaptic connectivity of cells mediating the CC or CT pathway. We show that CC-projecting cells encompass a broad spectrum of selectivity to stimulus orientation and are predominantly innervated by deep layer V1 neurons. In contrast, CT-projecting cells are ultrasparse firing, exquisitely tuned to orientation and direction information, and receive long-range input from higher cortical areas. This segregation in function and connectivity indicates that L6 microcircuits route specific contextual and stimulus-related information within and outside the cortical network.},

Stimuli were centered over the classical receptive field (CRF) and stimulus size was varied from one to four times the diameter of the CRF. Stimulus movies reproduced the spatial and temporal stimulus dynamics of natural vision while maintaining constant CRF stimulation across all sizes. In individual neurons, stimulation of the nCRF significantly increases the information rate, the information per spike, and the efficiency of information transmission. Furthermore, the population averages of these quantities also increase significantly with nCRF stimulation. These data demonstrate that the nCRF increases the sparseness of the stimulus representation in V1, suggesting that the nCRF tunes V1 neurons to match the highly informative components of the natural world.},

abstract = {Human language is recognized as a very complex domain since decades. No computer system has been able to reach human levels of performance so far. The only known computational system capable of proper language processing is the human brain. While we gather more and more data about the brain, its fundamental computational processes still remain obscure. The lack of a sound computational brain theory also prevents the fundamental understanding of Natural Language Processing. As always when science lacks a theoretical foundation, statistical modeling is applied to accommodate as many sampled real-world data as possible. An unsolved fundamental issue is the actual representation of language (data) within the brain, denoted as the Representational Problem. Starting with Jeff Hawkins' Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) theory, a consistent computational theory of the human cortex, we have developed a corresponding theory of language data representation: The Semantic Folding Theory. The process of encoding words, by using a topographic semantic space as distributional reference frame into a sparse binary representational vector is called Semantic Folding and is the central topic of this document. Semantic Folding describes a method of converting language from its symbolic representation (text) into an explicit, semantically grounded representation that can be generically processed by Hawkins' HTM networks. As it turned out, this change in representation, by itself, can solve many complex NLP problems by applying Boolean operators and a generic similarity function like the Euclidian Distance. Many practical problems of statistical NLP systems, like the high cost of computation, the fundamental incongruity of precision and recall , the complex tuning procedures etc., can be elegantly overcome by applying Semantic Folding.},

abstract = {Spontaneous activity fine-tunes neuronal connections in the developing brain. To explore the underlying synaptic plasticity mechanisms, we monitored naturally occurring changes in spontaneous activity at individual synapses with whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and simultaneous calcium imaging in the mouse visual cortex in vivo. Analyzing activity changes across large populations of synapses revealed a simple and efficient local plasticity rule: synapses that exhibit low synchronicity with nearby neighbors (<12 $\mu$m) become depressed in their transmission frequency. Asynchronous electrical stimulation of individual synapses in hippocampal slices showed that this is due to a decrease in synaptic transmission efficiency. Accordingly, experimentally increasing local synchronicity, by stimulating synapses in response to spontaneous activity at neighboring synapses, stabilized synaptic transmission. Finally, blockade of the high-affinity proBDNF receptor p75(NTR) prevented the depression of asynchronously stimulated synapses. Thus, spontaneous activity drives local synaptic plasticity at individual synapses in an "out-of-sync, lose-your-link" fashion through proBDNF/p75(NTR) signaling to refine neuronal connectivity.

We investigated the representation of episodic memory in hippocampal neurons of nine epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial monitoring as they discriminated between recently studied words (targets) and new words (foils) on a recognition test. On average, single units and multiunits exhibited higher spike counts in response to targets relative to foils, and the size of this effect correlated with behavioral performance. Further analyses of the spike-count distributions revealed that (i) a small percentage of recorded neurons responded to any one target and (ii) a small percentage of targets elicited a strong response in any one neuron. These findings are consistent with the idea that in the human hippocampus episodic memory is supported by a sparse distributed neural code.},

abstract = {The brain keeps track of the movements it makes so as to process sensory input accurately and coordinate complex movements gracefully. In this chapter we review the brain's strategies for keeping track of fast, saccadic eye movements. One way it does this is by monitoring copies of saccadic motor commands, or corollary discharges. It has been difficult to identify corollary discharge signals in the primate brain, although in some studies the influence of corollary discharge, for example on visual processing, has been found. We propose four criteria for identifying corollary discharge signals in primate brain based on our experiences studying a pathway from superior colliculus, in the brainstem, through mediodorsal thalamus to frontal eye field, in the prefrontal cortex. First, the signals must originate from a brain structure involved in generating movements. Second, they must begin just prior to movements and represent spatial attributes of the movements. Third, eliminating the signals should not impair movements in simple tasks not requiring corollary discharge. Fourth, eliminating the signals should, however, disrupt movements in tasks that require corollary discharge, such as a double-step task in which the monkey must keep track of one saccade in order to correctly generate another. Applying these criteria to the pathway from superior colliculus to frontal eye field, we concluded that it does indeed convey corollary discharge signals. The extent to which cerebral cortex actually uses these signals, particularly in the realm of sensory perception, remains unknown pending further studies. Moreover, many other ascending pathways from brainstem to cortex remain to be explored in behaving monkeys, and some of these, too, may carry corollary discharge signals.},

Here recordings in both anesthetized and awake rats demonstrate that after repeated stimulation with a moving spot that evoked sequential firing of an ensemble of primary visual cortex (V1) neurons, just a brief flash at the starting point of the motion path was sufficient to evoke a sequential firing pattern that reproduced the activation order evoked by the moving spot. The speed of recalled spike sequences may reflect the internal dynamics of the network rather than the motion speed. In awake rats, such recall was observed during a synchronized ('quiet wakeful') brain state having large-amplitude, low-frequency local field potential (LFP) but not in a desynchronized ('active') state having low-amplitude, high-frequency LFP. Such conditioning-enhanced, cue-evoked sequential spiking of a V1 ensemble may contribute to experience-based perceptual inference in a brain state-dependent manner.},

We report in mouse motor cortex that sleep after motor learning promotes the formation of postsynaptic dendritic spines on a subset of branches of individual layer V pyramidal neurons. New spines are formed on different sets of dendritic branches in response to different learning tasks and are protected from being eliminated when multiple tasks are learned. Neurons activated during learning of a motor task are reactivated during subsequent non-rapid eye movement sleep, and disrupting this neuronal reactivation prevents branch-specific spine formation. These findings indicate that sleep has a key role in promoting learning-dependent synapse formation and maintenance on selected dendritic branches, which contribute to memory storage.},

abstract = {Experience-dependent plasticity in adult visual cortex is believed to have important roles in visual coding and perceptual learning. Here we show that repeated stimulation with movies of natural scenes induces a rapid improvement in response reliability in cat visual cortex, whereas stimulation with white noise or flashed bar stimuli does not. The improved reliability can be accounted for by a selective increase in spiking evoked by preferred stimuli, and the magnitude of improvement depends on the sparseness of the response. The increase in reliability persists for at least several minutes in the absence of further movie stimulation. During this period, spontaneous spiking activity shows detectable reverberation of the movie-evoked responses. Thus, repeated exposure to natural stimuli not only induces a rapid improvement in cortical response reliability, but also leaves a 'memory trace' in subsequent spontaneous activity.},

abstract = {When presented with simple stimuli like bars and gratings, adjacent neurons in striate cortex exhibit shared selectivity for multiple stimulus dimensions, such as orientation, direction, and spatial frequency. This has led to the idea that local averaging of neuronal responses provides a more reliable representation of stimulus properties. However, when stimulated with complex, time-varying natural scenes (i.e., movies), striate neurons exhibit highly sparse responses. This raises the question of how much response heterogeneity the local population exhibits when stimulated with movies, and how it varies with separation distance between cells. We investigated this question by simultaneously recording the responses of groups of neurons in cat striate cortex to the repeated presentation of movies using silicon probes in a multi-tetrode configuration. We found, first, that the responses of striate neurons to movies are brief (tens of milliseconds), decorrelated, and exhibit high population sparseness. Second, we found that adjacent neurons differed significantly in their peak firing rates even when they responded to the same frames of a movie. Third, pairs of adjacent neurons recorded on the same tetrodes exhibited as much heterogeneity in their responses as pairs recorded by different tetrodes. These findings demonstrate that complex natural scenes evoke highly heterogeneous responses within local populations, suggesting that response redundancy in a cortical column is substantially lower than previously thought.},

Unitary EPSPs evoked by the activation of LH and SH connections had smaller amplitude and larger coefficient of variation than those evoked by stimulating the vertical input.

The EPSPs evoked by simultaneous activation of LH and vertical inputs summated linearly at the resting membrane potential. However, the EPSPs evoked by stimulation of the two inputs were nonlinearly (supralinearly) summated when the postsynaptic membrane was depolarized to a certain level.

We find three spatial patterns of Ca2+ accumulations: an apical band in the apical dendrite approximately 500 microns from the soma, an accumulation restricted to the basal dendrites, soma, and proximal apical dendrite, and a combination of both of these. We show that the apical band can be activated antidromically and synaptically and that, under blocked Na+ and K+ conductances, it generates Ca2+ spikes. Thus, the apical band may serve as a dendritic trigger zone for regenerative Ca2+ spikes or as a current amplifier for distal synaptic events.

abstract = {Recent electron microscopic studies provide evidence that the adult cortex generates new synapses in response to sensory activity and that these structural changes can occur rapidly, within 24 hr of sensory stimulation. Together with progress imaging synapses in vivo, the stage appears set for advances in understanding the dynamics and mechanisms of experience-dependent synaptogenesis.},
annote = {This is a short review of activity-dependent synaptogenesis in the adult cortex. This review first talks about the common view of synaptic plasticity, which argues initial establishment of synaptic connections occurs independent of learning, and experience refines existing synaptic connections, rather than create new ones (para 2, page 1). Zito and Svoboda then presented a different view, which argues {\&}quot;short-term plasticity depends on existing synapses, but long term changes in synaptic strength are accompanied by structural rearrangements, through formation or elimination},
