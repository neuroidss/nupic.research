  Runs a basic experiment on continuous locations, learning a few locations on
  four basic objects, and inferring one of them.

  This experiment is mostly used for testing the pipeline, as the learned
  locations are too random and sparse to actually perform inference.

  Parameters:
  ----------------------------
  @param    noiseLevel (float)
            Noise level to add to the locations and features during inference

  @param    profile (bool)
            If True, the network will be profiled after learning and inference
