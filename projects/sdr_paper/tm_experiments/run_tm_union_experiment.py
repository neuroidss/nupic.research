  Run an experiment tracking the performance of the temporal memory given
  different input dimensions.  The number of active cells is kept fixed, so we
  are in effect varying the sparsity of the input.   We track performance by
  comparing the cells predicted to be active with the cells actually active in
  the sequence without noise at every timestep, and averaging across timesteps.
  Three metrics are used, correlation (Pearson's r, by numpy.corrcoef),
  set similarity (Jaccard index) and cosine similarity (using
  scipy.spatial.distance.cosine).  The Jaccard set similarity is the
  canonical metric used in the paper, but all three tend to produce very similar
  results.

  Output is written to tm_dim_{num_active}.txt, including sample size.

  We tested two different dimension settings, 2000 and 4000.
