# Description

Initial experiments with feedback and temporal memory. Temporal memory was
extended to include apical connections.

# Abstract

In the process of writing a paper. Here is the abstract so far:

Information processing in the cortex is hierarchical and bidirectional. Neurons
simultaneously receive feedforward input from lower levels of the hierarchy and
topdown feedback input from higher levels. Experimental evidence demonstrates
that both feedforward and feedback are critical for determining a neuronâ€™s
receptive field. In this paper we explore how feedback can be incorporated into
Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) systems. In the cortex, pyramidal neurons
receive significant feedback input from higher levels through their apical
dendrites. As such we extend the HTM implementation of neurons by adding apical
dendrites and explore novel activation and learning rules for integrating the
various sources of inputs. Our results demonstrate that, under appropriate
conditions, an HTM with feedback possesses two new abilities: the ability to use
higher-level knowledge for the disambiguation of multiple possible sensory
inputs, and the ability to retain high-order temporal context in the presence of
input sequence variation. We propose that the implementation can offer immediate
practical value to HTM systems, help advance our understanding of the role of
feedback in the cortex, and reveal several promising avenues for future work.
