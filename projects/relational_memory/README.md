# Relational Memory Experiments

## TODO

- Add temporal clustering
    - expect near perfect sensory prediction
- Hotgym
- MNIST with saccading sensor
- MNIST with multiple cortical columns with overlapping RFs
- Add behavior
    - L5 transforms remember the associated motor command
    - Want to drive the L5 transform that is "closest" to destination state
    - Object repr learns weighted values for which L5 transforms lead to it
    - Simple external reward center remembers object state when reward is received and later can drive it
