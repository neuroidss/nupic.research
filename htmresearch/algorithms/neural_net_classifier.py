  The Neural Network Classifier accepts a binary input pattern from the
  level below (the "activationPattern") and information from the sensor and
  encoders (the "classification") describing the true (target) input.

  The neural network maps input patterns to class labels. There are as many
  output units as the number of class labels (buckets). The output is a
  probabilistic distribution over all class labels

  During inference, the output is calculated by first doing a weighted summation
  of all the inputs, and then perform a softmax nonlinear function to get
  the predicted distribution of class labels

  During learning, the connection weights between input units and output units
  are adjusted to maximize the likelihood of the model
